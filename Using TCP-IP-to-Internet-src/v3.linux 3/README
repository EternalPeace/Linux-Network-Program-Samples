	This is the source distribution for "Internetworking with TCP/IP,
volume III," by Douglas E. Comer and David L. Stevens (Prentice Hall 2000).
This code is for the Linux/POSIX sockets version.
	Note that some versions of UNIX do not define "u_short" in the include
file <sys/types.h>. In the interests of compatibility with the published
sources, a portability fix for that has not been included. If you have problems
because of "u_short" being undefined, try adding the following line either in
the affected files, or one of the include files they include:

	typedef	unsigned short	u_short;

	Bug reports may be directed via e-mail to "dls@sequent.com" or
"comer@cs.purdue.edu".
	Thank you for your interest in the book!
