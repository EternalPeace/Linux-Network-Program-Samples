This directory contains the code to construct simulators for SEQ, SEQ+, and
the variants of it described in the homework exercises.

Two forms of the simulator can be constructed:
	seq_tk, seq+_tk: Uses a graphic user interface.  Nice for visualizing
		and debugging.  Requires installation of Tcl/Tk.
	seq_tty, seq+_tty: Prints all information about its runtime behavior
		on the terminal.  Hard to understand what's going on,
		but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require
		any special installation features.

For the two SEQ simulators, different "versions" can be constructed to use
	different HCL files when working on the different homework problems

	VERSION		HCL File	Description
	std		seq-std.hcl	Standard simulator (default)
	full		seq-full.hcl	For adding iaddl and leave

Simulators can be constructed using make.  Just say:

	make seq_tty VERSION=xxx
		or
	make seq_tk VERSION=xxx

Where "xxx" is one of the versions listed above.
