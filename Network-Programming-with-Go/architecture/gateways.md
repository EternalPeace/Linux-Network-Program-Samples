## Gateways

A gateway is a generic term for an entity used to connect two or more networks. A repeater operates at the physical level and copies the information from one subnet to another. A bridge operates at the data link layer level and copies frames between networks. A router operates at the network level and not only moves information between networks but also decides on the route.
