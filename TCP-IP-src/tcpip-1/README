Preface
-------

	This source code is being made available to let readers of the book
"TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols" experiment with TCP/IP,
using the same tools that were used in writing the book.

	THIS SOURCE CODE IS *NOT* POLISHED, EXTENSIVELY DEBUGGED CODE.

	A later version of these programs will probably appear in the next
edition of the author's book "UNIX Network Programming", probably in 1995,
at which time the code will be polished.  For this reason, the source code
for the sock program is copyrighted by the author, as you'll see in each
source file.  You may use this program for your own educational purposes,
but I don't want copies appearing elsewhere until a polished version has
been published in book form.

	Here is a listing of the systems and compilers that I've compiled
and tested the programs under.  I do not have superuser privilege on some
of the systems, so I wasn't able to test all the programs in all the
environments (non-SU indicates these systems).

		Solaris 2.3, gcc
		Solaris 2.3, acc     (non-SU)
		SunOS 4.1.3, gcc
		SunOS 4.1.3, acc     (non-SU)
		SVR4/386
		BSD/386 Version 1.0
		4.4BSD               (non-SU)
		AIX 3.2.2            (non-SU)
		DEC OSF/1 V1.3       (non-SU)

It's pretty simple code, so it should port to other Unix boxes quite easily.
***** THE CODE FOR THE sock PROGRAM REQUIRES AN ANSI C COMPILER. *****
