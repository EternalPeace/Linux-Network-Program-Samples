     The vvggrriinnddeeffss file contains all language definitions for vgrind(1).  The
     data base is very similar to termcap(5).

     The following table names and describes each field.

     The following entry, which describes the C language, is typical of a lan-
     guage entry.

     C|c::pb=^\d?*?\d?\p\d?\(\a?\):bb={:be=}:cb=/*:ce=*/:sb=":se=\e":\
     :lb=':le=\e':tl:\
     :kw=asm auto break case char continue default do double else enum\
     extern float for fortran goto if int long register return short\
     sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned while #define\
     #else #endif #if #ifdef #ifndef #include #undef # define else endif\
     if ifdef ifndef include undef:

     Note that the first field is just the language name (and any variants of
     it).  Thus the C language could be specified to vgrind(1) as "c" or "C".

     Entries may continue onto multiple lines by giving a \ as the last char-
     acter of a line.  Capabilities in vvggrriinnddeeffss are of two types: Boolean ca-
     pabilities which indicate that the language has some particular feature
     and string capabilities which give a regular expression or keyword list.

     VVggrriinnddeeffss uses regular expression which are very similar to those of
     ex(1) and lex(1).  The characters `^', `$', `:' and `\' are reserved
     characters and must be "quoted" with a preceding `\' if they are to be
     included as normal characters.  The metasymbols and their meanings are:

     $       the end of a line

     ^       the beginning of a line

     \d      a delimiter (space, tab, newline, start of line)


     \a      matches any string of symbols (like .* in lex)

     \p      matches any alphanumeric name.  In a procedure definition (pb)
             the string that matches this symbol is used as the procedure
             name.

     ()      grouping

     |       alternation

     ?       last item is optional

     \e      preceding any string means that the string will not match an in-
             put string if the input string is preceded by an escape character
             (\).  This is typically used for languages (like C) which can in-
             clude the string delimiter in a string by escaping it.

     Unlike other regular expressions in the system,  these match words and
     not characters.  Hence something like "(tramp|steamer)flies?"  would
     match "tramp", "steamer", "trampflies", or "steamerflies".

KKEEYYWWOORRDD LLIISSTT
     The keyword list is just a list of keywords in the language separated by
     spaces.  If the "oc" boolean is specified, indicating that upper and low-
     er case are equivalent, then all the keywords should be specified in low-
     er case.
