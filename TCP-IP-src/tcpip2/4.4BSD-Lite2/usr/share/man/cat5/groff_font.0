       groff_font  -  format of groff device and font description
       files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The groff font format is roughly a superset of the ditroff
       font  format.  Unlike the ditroff font format, there is no
       associated binary format.  The font files for device  _n_a_m_e
       are stored in a directory ddeevv_n_a_m_e_.  There are two types of
       file: a device description file called DDEESSCC and  for  each
       font  _F a font file called _F.  These are text files; there
       is no associated binary format.

   DDEESSCC ffiillee ffoorrmmaatt
       The DESC file can contain the following types of line:

       rreess _n  There are _n machine units per inch.

       hhoorr _n  The horizontal resolution is _n machine units.

       vveerrtt _n The vertical resolution is _n machine units.

       ssiizzeessccaallee _n
              The scale factor for pointsizes.  By  default  this
              has a value of 1.  One _s_c_a_l_e_d _p_o_i_n_t is equal to one
              point/_n.  The arguments to the uunniittwwiiddtthh and  ssiizzeess
              commands are given in scaled points.

       uunniittwwiiddtthh _n
              Quantities  in  the font files are given in machine
              units for  fonts  whose  point  size  is  _n  scaled
              points.

       ttccoommmmaanndd
              This  means that the postprocessor can handle the tt
              and uu output commands.

       ssiizzeess _s_1 _s_2_._._._s_n 00
              This  means  that  the  device  has  fonts  at  _s_1,
              _s_2,..._s_n  scaled points.  The list of sizes must be
              terminated by a 00.  Each ss_i can also be a range  of
              sizes  _m-_n.  The list can extend over more than one
              line.

       ssttyylleess _S_1 _S_2_._._._S_m
              The first _m font positions will be associated  with
              styles _S_1_._._._S_m.

       ffoonnttss _n _F_1 _F_2 _F_3_._._._F_n
              Fonts _F_1_._._._F_n will be mounted in the font positions
              _m+1,...,_m+_n where _m is the number of styles.   This

              command may extend over more than one line.  A font
              name of 00 will cause no font to be mounted  on  the
              corresponding font position.

       ffaammiillyy _f_a_m
              The default font family is _f_a_m.

       cchhaarrsseett
              This  line and everything following in the file are
              ignored.  It is allowed for the sake  of  backwards
              compatibility.

       The  res, unitwidth, fonts and sizes lines are compulsory.
       Other commands are ignored by ttrrooffff but  may  be  used  by
       postprocessors  to  store  arbitrary information about the
       device in the DESC file.

   FFoonntt ffiillee ffoorrmmaatt
       A font file has two  sections.  The  first  section  is  a
       sequence  of  lines  each  containing  a sequence of blank
       delimited words; the first word in the line is a key,  and
       subsequent words give a value for that key.

       nnaammee _F The name of the font is _F.

       ssppaacceewwiiddtthh _n
              The normal width of a space is _n.

       ssllaanntt _n
              The  characters  of  the  font  have  a  slant of _n
              degrees. (Positive means forward.)

       lliiggaattuurreess _l_i_g_1 _l_i_g_2_._._._l_i_g_n [00]
              Characters _l_i_g_1, _l_i_g_2,...,_l_i_g_n are ligatures;  pos-
              sible  ligatures are ffff, ffii, ffll and ffffll.  For back-
              wards compatibiliy, the list of  ligatures  may  be
              terminated with a 00..  The list of ligatures may not
              extend over more than one line.

       ssppeecciiaall
              The font is _s_p_e_c_i_a_l; this means that when a charac-
              ter is requested that is not present in the current
              font, it will be searched for in any special  fonts
              that are mounted.

       Other  commands  are  ignored  by ttrrooffff but may be used by
       postprocessors to store arbitrary  information  about  the
       font in the font file.

       The  first  section  can contain comments which start with
       the ## character and extend to the end of a line.

       The second section contains one or  two  subsections.   It
       must  contain a _c_h_a_r_s_e_t subsection and it may also contain
       a _k_e_r_n_p_a_i_r_s subsection.  These subsections can  appear  in
       any  order.   Each subsection starts with a word on a line
       by itself.

       The word  cchhaarrsseett  starts  the  charset  subsection.   The
       cchhaarrsseett  line  is  followed  by a sequence of lines.  Each
       line gives information for one  character.   A  line  com-
       prises a number of fields separated by blanks or tabs. The
       format is

              _n_a_m_e _m_e_t_r_i_c_s _t_y_p_e _c_o_d_e _c_o_m_m_e_n_t

       _n_a_m_e identifies the character: if _n_a_m_e is a single charac-
       ter  _c then it corresponds to the groff input character _c;
       if it is of the form \\_c where c  is  a  single  character,
       then  it corresponds to the groff input character \\_c; oth-
       erwise it corresponds to the groff input character \\[[_n_a_m_e]]
       (if  it  is exactly two characters _x_x it can be entered as
       \\((_x_x.)  Groff supports eight bit characters; however  some
       utilities has difficulties with eight bit characters.  For
       this reason, there is a convention that the name cchhaarr_n  is
       equivalent  to the single character whose code is _n _.  For
       example, cchhaarr116633 would be equivalent to the character with
       code 163 which is the pounds sterling sign in ISO Latin-1.
       The name ------ is special and indicates that  the  character
       is  unnamed;  such characters can only be used by means of
       the \\NN escape sequence in ttrrooffff.

       The _t_y_p_e field gives the character type:

       1      means the character has an descender, for  example,
              p;

       2      means  the  character has an ascender, for example,
              b;

       3      means the character has  both  an  ascender  and  a
              descender, for example, (.

       The _c_o_d_e field gives the code which the postprocessor uses
       to print the character.  The character can also  be  input
       to  groff  using  this  code  by  means  of  the \\NN escape
       sequence.  The code can be any integer.  If it starts with
       a  00 it will be interpreted as octal; if it starts with 00xx
       or 00XX it will be intepreted as hexdecimal.

       Anything on the line after the code field will be ignored.

       The _m_e_t_r_i_c_s field has the form:

              _w_i_d_t_h[,,_h_e_i_g_h_t[,,_d_e_p_t_h[,,_i_t_a_l_i_c___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n[,,_l_e_f_t___i_t_a_l_i_c___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n[,,_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n]]]]]

       There must not be  any  spaces  between  these  subfields.
       Missing  subfields are assumed to be 0.  The subfields are
       all decimal integers.  Since there is no associated binary
       format,  these values are not required to fit into a vari-
       able of type cchhaarr as they are in ditroff.  The _w_i_d_t_h  sub-
       fields  gives the width of the character.  The _h_e_i_g_h_t sub-
       field gives the height of the character (upwards is  posi-
       tive);  if a character does not extend above the baseline,
       it should be given a zero height, rather than  a  negative
       height.  The _d_e_p_t_h subfield gives the depth of the charac-
       ter, that is, the distance below the  lowest  point  below
       the  baseline to which the character extends (downwards is
       positive); if a character does not extend below above  the
       baseline,  it  should be given a zero depth, rather than a
       negative depth.  The _i_t_a_l_i_c___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n subfield gives  the
       amount  of  space that should be added after the character
       when it is immediately to be followed by a character  from
       a  roman  font.  The _l_e_f_t___i_t_a_l_i_c___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n subfield gives
       the amount of space that should be added before the  char-
       acter when it is immediately to be preceded by a character
       from a roman font.   The  _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t___c_o_r_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  gives  the
       amount  of  space  that  should be added after a character
       before adding a subscript.  This should be less  than  the
       italic correction.

       A line in the charset section can also have the format

              _n_a_m_e ""

       This  indicates  that  _n_a_m_e  is  just another name for the
       character mentioned in the preceding line.

       The word kkeerrnnppaaiirrss starts  the  kernpairs  section.   This
       contains a sequence of lines of the form:

              _c_1 _c_2 _n

       This  means that when character _c_1 appears next to charac-
       ter _c_2 the space between them should be  increased  by  _n.
       Most  entries  in  kernpairs  section will have a negative
       value for _n.
