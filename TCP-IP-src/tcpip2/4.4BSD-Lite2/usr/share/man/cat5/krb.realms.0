       /etc/kerberosIV/krb.realms - host to Kerberos realm trans-
       lation file

       _k_r_b_._r_e_a_l_m_s provides a translation from a hostname  to  the
       Kerberos  realm  name  for  the  services provided by that
       host.

       Each line of the translation file is in one of the follow-
       ing  forms  (domain_name  should  be of the form .XXX.YYY,
       e.g. .LCS.MIT.EDU):
            host_name kerberos_realm
            domain_name kerberos_realm
       If a hostname exactly matches the  _h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e  field  in  a
       line  of  the  first  form, the corresponding realm is the
       realm of the host.  If  a  hostname  does  not  match  any
       _h_o_s_t___n_a_m_e  in the file, but its domain exactly matches the
       _d_o_m_a_i_n___n_a_m_e field in a line of the second form, the corre-
       sponding realm is the realm of the host.

       If  no translation entry applies, the host's realm is con-
       sidered to be the hostname's domain portion  converted  to
       upper case.
