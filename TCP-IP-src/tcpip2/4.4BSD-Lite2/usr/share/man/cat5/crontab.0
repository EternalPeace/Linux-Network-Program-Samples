     The ccrroonnttaabb file contains the schedules used by the cron(8) daemon.  Each
     line in the schedule gives a time of execution and the command to be exe-
     cuted.

     A line consists of two fields giving the time, three fields giving the
     day, a user name field, and lastly the command to be executed.  The first
     five fields are space or tab separated and may consist of a number, a
     comma separated list of numbers, or an asterisk meaning any or all possi-
     ble values.  The last field (the command field) may contain spaces.  A
     field containing two hyphen separated numbers is treated as an inclusive
     range.

     The fields are:

           1.   The minute of the hour, a number from 0 to 59.

           2.   The hour, a number from 0 to 23.

           3.   The day in terms of the month, a number from 1 to 31.

           4.   The month in terms of the year, a number from 1 to 12.

           5.   The day in terms of the week, a number from 1 to 7.  Monday is
                considered day one, Sunday is day seven.

           6.   The name of a user: the command will be run with the user's
                uid and permissions.

           7.   The command to execute.  This field may be terminated with a
                newline or the `%' character.

     An optional file ccrroonnttaabb..llooccaall may be created and used for additional
     scheduling.

     In the example below, the first field indicates the command should be ex-
     ecuted at the hour, a quarter past the hour, on the half hour and at a
     quarter to the hour.  The next four fields indicate the command should be
     run every hour, every day. The sixth field indicates the command is to be
     run with root privileges.

           0,15,30,45 * * * *      root /usr/libexec/atrun

     In this next example, the first field indicates this command should be
     executed on the half hour.  The second field constrains the hour to 3
     A.M. The third and fourth fields indicate any day of the month and any
     month of the year, but are constrained by the fifth field to the sixth
     day of the week (Saturday).  The command is to be executed with root
     privileges. The example shown here has been folded (spread across two
     lines) to make it readable.  It must not be folded in the the ccrroonnttaabb
     file.
