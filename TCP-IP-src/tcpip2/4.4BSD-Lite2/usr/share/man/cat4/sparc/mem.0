     mmeemm, kkmmeemm - main memory

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The file //ddeevv//mmeemm is an interface to the physical memory of the computer.
     Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
     Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing memory
     itself.  An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference an
     offset outside of //ddeevv//mmeemm.

     Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file //ddeevv//kkmmeemm in the same man-
     ner as //ddeevv//mmeemm. Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped
     to memory are allowed.

SSPPAARRCC
     On the SPARC, physical memory may be discontiguous; kernel virtual memory
     begins at 0xf8000000.
