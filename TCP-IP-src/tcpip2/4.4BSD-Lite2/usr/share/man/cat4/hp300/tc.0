     ttcc - HP98544 98550 ``Topcat'' and ``Catseye'' device interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This driver is for the HP98544, 98545 and 98547 ``Topcat'' and HP98548,
     98549, and 98550 ``Catseye'' display cards.  This driver merely checks
     for the existence of the device and does minimal set up, as it is expect-
     ed the applications will initialize the device to their requirements.
     The Topcat and Catseye are nearly identical in common usage and only the
     Topcat will be referred to from now on.

     The Topcat display cards are not user configurable.  If one is present on
     a system, it will always have a frame buffer address of 0x200000 and a
     control register address of 0x560000.  These are the HP series 300 ITE
     (Internal Terminal Emulator) defaults.  The device can also be used as a
     graphics output device.

     The ioctl(2) calls supported by the BSD system for the Topcat are:

     GRFIOCGINFO  Get Graphics Info

                  Get info about device, setting the entries in the _g_r_f_i_n_f_o
                  structure, as defined in <_h_p_d_e_v_/_g_r_f_i_o_c_t_l_._h>. For the 98544
                  or 98549, the number of planes should be 1, as they are
                  monochrome devices.  The number of planes for a 98545 is 4,
                  translating to 15 colors, excluding black.  The 98547 and
                  98548 cards have 6 planes, yielding 63 colors and black.
                  The 98550 has 8 planes, yielding 255 colors and black.  The
                  displayed frame buffer size for the 98549 and 98550 is 2048
                  x 1024, for the others it is 1024 x 768.

     GRFIOCON     Graphics On

                  Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen will
                  come on, displaying whatever is in the frame buffer, using
                  whatever colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF    Graphics Off

                  Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT. The frame
                  buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP    Map Device to user space

                  Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once the de-
                  vice file is mapped, the frame buffer structure is accessi-
                  ble.  The frame buffer structure describing Topcat/Catseye
                  devices is defined in <_h_p_d_e_v_/_g_r_f___t_c_r_e_g_._h>.

     For further information about the use of ioctl see the man page.
