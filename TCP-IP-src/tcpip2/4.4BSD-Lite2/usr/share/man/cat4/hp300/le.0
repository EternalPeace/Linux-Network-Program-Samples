     The llee interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
     AMD 7990 LANCE Ethernet chip set.

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
     SIOCSIFADDR ioctl.  The le interface employs the address resolution pro-
     tocol described in arp(4) to dynamically map between Internet and Ether-
     net addresses on the local network.

     The use of ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying data on input
     and output is supported by the interface but offers no advantage due to
     the large HP page size.  The use of trailers is negotiated with ARP. This
     negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the
     IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     noting the 6 byte physical ethernet address of the adapter.

     dresses formatted in an unsuitable address family; the packet was
     dropped.

     The following message indicates a possible hardware error performing the
     indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.

     tialize command during reset.  The reset procedure continues anyway.
