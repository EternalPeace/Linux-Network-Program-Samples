     ggbb - HP98700 ``Gatorbox'' device interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This driver is for the HP98700 and 98710 graphics devices, also known as
     the Gatorbox.  The term ``Gator'' will often be used, and it is not to be
     confused with ``Gator'' used in reference to an HP 9837 or 200/237 ma-
     chine.  Also, the term Gatorbox is used for the 98700 alone, with the
     98701 frame buffer memory or with the 98710 accelerator installed.  This
     driver merely checks for the existence of the device and does minimal set
     up, as it is expected the applications will initialize the device to
     their requirements.

     The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a system, in which
     case it will be used as the system console.  It can also be installed as
     a secondary display device.  For the first case, the HP 98287A M.A.D. in-
     terface card should be set to internal control space.  This will put the
     frame buffer at the DIO address 0x200000 and the control registers at
     0x560000.  At this address it will be the ``preferred'' console device
     (see cons(4)).  For use as a secondary device, the 98287A should be set
     to frame buffer address 0x300000, and to an external select code.

     It should be noted that this configuration will conflict with the 98547
     display card which has a 2 megabyte frame buffer starting at address
     0x200000.  The 98700 should only be installed as a secondary device in a
     machine with a 1 bit 98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.  The _9_8_7_0_0_H
     _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_a_t_i_o_n _G_u_i_d_e contains further configuration information.

     The ioctl(2) calls supported by the BSD system for the Gatorbox are:

     GRFIOCGINFO
             Get Graphics Info

             Get info about device, setting the entries in the _g_r_f_i_n_f_o struc-
             ture, as defined in <_h_p_d_e_v_/_g_r_f_i_o_c_t_l_._h>. For the standard 98700,
             the number of planes should be 4.  The number of colors would
             therefore be 15, excluding black.  With the 98701 option in-
             stalled there will be another 4 planes for a total of 8, giving
             255 colors.

     GRFIOCON
             Graphics On

             Turn graphics on by enabling CRT output.  The screen will come
             on, displaying whatever is in the frame buffer, using whatever
             colormap is in place.

     GRFIOCOFF
             Graphics Off

             Turn graphics off by disabling output to the CRT. The frame
             buffer contents are not affected.

     GRFIOCMAP
             Map Device to user space

             Map in control registers and framebuffer space. Once the device
             file is mapped, the frame buffer structure is accessible.  The
             frame buffer structure describing the 98700 is given in
             <_h_p_d_e_v_/_g_r_f___g_b_r_e_g_._h>.

     GRFIOCUNMAP
             Unmap Device

             Unmap control registers and framebuffer space.

             For further information about the use of ioctl see the man page.

     A small example of opening, mapping and using the device is given below.
     For more examples of the details on the behavior of the device, see the
     device dependent source files for the X Window System, in the

           struct gboxfb *gbox;
           u_char *Addr, frame_buffer;
           struct grfinfo gi;
           int disp_fd;

           disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0",1);

           if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCGINFO, &gi) < 0) return -1;

           (void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

           Addr = (u_char *) 0;
           if (ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCMAP, &Addr) < 0) {
           (void) ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
           return -1;
           }
           gbox = (gboxfb *) Addr;                         /* Control Registers   */
           frame_buffer = (u_char *) Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
