     The cartridge tape interface as found in the 7946 and 9144 products pro-
     vides a standard tape drive interface as described in mtio(4) with the
     following exceptions:

     1.   There is only one density.

     2.   Only the ``raw'' interface is supported.

     3.   The MTIOCTOP ioctl(2) is limited.  In particular, the command, MTFSR
          is not supported.

     4.   The MTIOCGET ioctl is not supported.

     5.   The record size for read and write operations must be between 1K and
          64K inclusive.

     Special files _r_c_t_0 through _r_c_t_3 refer to rewind on close interfaces to
     drives 0 to 3.  Files _r_c_t_4 through _r_c_t_7 refer to no-rewind interfaces.
     Files _r_c_t_8 through _r_c_t_1_1 refer to streaming rewind on close interfaces.
     (Only 9144 type devices can stream.)  Lastly, _r_c_t_1_2 through _r_c_t_1_5 refer
     to streaming no-rewind interfaces.

     Read and writes of less than 1024 bytes will not behave as expected.
