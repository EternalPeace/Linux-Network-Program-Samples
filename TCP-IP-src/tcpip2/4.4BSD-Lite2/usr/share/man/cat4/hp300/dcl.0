     The 98628A is a buffered EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) communications inter-
     face.  It has one port with full modem control.

     Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates; 0,
     50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
     19200.

     An optional argument _f_l_a_g_s may be set to 1 if the line should be treated
     as hard-wired with carrier always present, or to 0 if modem control is
     desired.

     Use HP cable "98626 & 98628 opts.002, RS232-C DCE CABLE, 5061-4216" to
     attach non-modem devices.  Use HP cable "98626 & 98628 opts.001, RS232-C
     DTE CABLE, 5061-4215" to attach modems.

     The 98628A has a 256 byte input silo and a 256 output silo. Input inter-
     rupts happen on a per character basis.

     The high water and low water marks in the kernel tty routines are com-
     pletely inappropriate for a device like this with a large input buffer.
     Don't use tandem mode if possible.  A fast system can handle input at
     19.2K baud without receive overflow.

     For output to devices that make heavy use of XON/XOFF a write size of
     less then 256 will improve performance marginally.

     Breaks received at a faster rate then 1 break every second will be recog-
     nized as a single break.

     Console use is not supported.

     The RS-422/423/499, MTS-DSN/DL modes of the card are not supported.
