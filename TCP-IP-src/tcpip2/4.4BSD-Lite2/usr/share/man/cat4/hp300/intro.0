DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section describes the special files, related driver functions, and
     networking support available in the system.  In this part of the manual,
     the SYNOPSIS section of each configurable device gives a sample specifi-
     cation for use in constructing a system description for the config(8)
     program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the
     console and/or in the system error log _/_u_s_r_/_a_d_m_/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s due to errors in
     device operation; see syslogd(8) for more information.

     This section contains both devices which may be configured into the sys-
     tem and network related information.  The networking support is intro-
     duced in netintro(4).

     This section describes the hardware supported on the HP 9000/300 series.
     Software support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware device
     may be supported with a character or block _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r, or it may be
     used within the networking subsystem and have a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r.
     Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file system
     of a special type; see mknod(8).  Network interfaces are indirectly ac-
     cessed through the interprocess communication facilities provided by the
     system; see socket(2).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time and
     the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled into
     the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the autoconfiguration
     facilities in the system probe for the device and, if found, enable the
     software support for it.  If a device does not respond at autoconfigura-
     tion time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.  To enable a de-
     vice which did not autoconfigure, the system will have to be rebooted.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in autoconf(4).  A list of the
     supported devices is given below.

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of the system.
     Pseudo-devices are not listed.  Devices are indicated by their functional
     interface.  Occasionally, new devices of a similar type may be added
     simply by creating appropriate table entries in the driver; for example,
     new CS/80 drives.
