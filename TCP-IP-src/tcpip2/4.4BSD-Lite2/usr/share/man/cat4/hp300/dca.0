     The 98644A is a single port EIA RS-232C (CCITT V.28) communications in-
     terface with a single character buffer.  Such an interface is built-in to
     all series 300 machines.

     Input and output for each line may set to one of following baud rates;
     50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600 or 19200.

     An optional argument _f_l_a_g_s may be set to 1 if the line should be treated
     as hard-wired with carrier always present or 0 if modem control is de-
     sired.

     Data loss is possible on busy systems with baud rates greater than 300.
     The ddccaa has never been tested with modem control enabled or on anything
     but the built-in interface.
