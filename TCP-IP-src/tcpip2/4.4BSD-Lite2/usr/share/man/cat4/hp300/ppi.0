DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ppppii interface provides a means of communication with HP-IB printers
     and plotters.

     Special files _p_p_i_0 through _p_p_i_7 are used to access the devices, with the
     digit at the end of the filename referring to the bus address of the de-
     vice.  Current versions of the autoconf code can not probe for these de-
     vices, so the device entry in the configuration file must be fully quali-
     fied.

     The device files appear as follows:

           "crw-rw-rw-  1 root      11,   0 Dec 21 11:22 /dev/ppi"

BBUUGGSS
     This driver is very primitive, it handshakes data out byte by byte.  It
     should use DMA if possible.
