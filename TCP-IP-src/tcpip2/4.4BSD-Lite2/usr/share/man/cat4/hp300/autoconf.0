     When UNIX bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine on which it is
     running and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
     what it finds on the console.  This procedure is driven by a system con-
     figuration table which is processed by config(8) and compiled into each
     kernel.

     Autoconfiguration on the HP300s is similar to that on the VAX, the prima-
     ry difference is in the naming conventions.  On the HP300, if devices ex-
     ist which are not configured they will be ignored; if devices exist of
     unsupported type they will be ignored.

     Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded as the root
     filesystem.  If that is not possible, a generic system will use `rd0' if
     it exists.  If such a system is booted with the RB_ASKNAME option (see
     reboot(2)),  then the name of the root device is read from the console
     terminal at boot time, and any available device may be used.

     doesn't (or at least this compiled version of UNIX doesn't) understand.

     with ipl%d (interrupt priority level).  UNIX will call it hpib%d.

     For disks `%s%d' will look like `rd0', for tapes like `ct0'. The `%s' in
     the first line will be a product type like ``7945A'' or ``9144''.  The
     slave number comes from the address select switches on the drive.

     ggrrff%%dd aatt sscc%%dd  A bit mapped display was found either at the ``internal''
     address (first case) or at some ``external'' select code (second case).
     If it exists, the internal display will always be unit 0.

     the indicated select code and with indicated interrupt priority level.
     `%s' will be one of dca(4) (single-port serial interfaces), dcm(4) (four-
     port serial interfaces), or le(4) (LAN cards).  The slave number comes
     from the address select switches on the interface card.
