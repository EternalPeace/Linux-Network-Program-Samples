     The Cipher F880, M990/ Tapemaster combination provides a standard tape
     drive interface as described in mt(4).  The Cipher F880 tape drive oper-
     ates at 1600 or 3200 BPI - controlled by a switch on the drive.  The Ci-
     pher M990 operates at 1600, 3200 or 6250 BPI - controlled by switches on
     the front of the drive.

     The Tapemaster controller board is actually a Multibus controller ac-
     cessed through a Halversa Multibus to VERSAbus converter card.

     ccyy%%dd:: %%ddkkbb bbuuffffeerr..  The formatter was found to have a `%d' kilobyte
     buffer during autoconfiguration.

     an error occurred on a nop command during autoconfiguration; the con-
     troller may be hung.

     ccyy%%dd:: ccoonnffiigguurraattiioonn ffaaiilluurree,, ssttaattuuss==%%bb..  The controller timed out or an
     error occurred on a configure command during autoconfiguration; the con-
     troller may be hung.

     yycc%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg..  An attempt was made to write on the tape drive when
     no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of the
     user who tried to access the tape.

     yycc%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee..  An attempt was made to access the tape while it was
     offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to
     access the tape.

     ccyy%%dd:: ii//oo ssiizzee ttoooo llaarrggee..  A read or a write request exceeded the maximum
     transfer size for the controller - 32 kilobytes; this message is written
     on the terminal of the user who made the read or write request.

     yycc%%dd:: hhaarrdd eerrrroorr bbnn%%dd ssttaattuuss==%%bb..  A tape error occurred at block _b_n; the
     cy error register is printed in hexadecimal with the bits symbolically
     decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw tape; when possible the driver
     will have retried the operation which failed several times before report-
     ing the error.  For known errors, the trailing `%s' is one of the follow-
     ing:

     ttiimmeeoouutt,, ttiimmeeoouutt11,, ttiimmeeoouutt22,, ttiimmeeoouutt33,, ttiimmeeoouutt44..  Time out errors; this
     may be due to trying to read a blank tape or the controller failing to
     interrupt or the drive dropping off-line.

     nnoonn--eexxiisstteenntt mmeemmoorryy..  A controller transfer to memory timed out.

     bbllaannkk ttaappee..  The controller detected a blank tape when data was expected.

     micro-diagnostics or the diagnostic mode jumper was not installed while
     attempting to execute a diagnostics command.

     eeoott//bboott ddeetteecctteedd..  The controller unexpectedly encountered end-of-tape or


     beginning-of-tape during an operation.

     rreettrryy uunnssuucccceessssffuull..  An error occurred which could not be recovered by
     repeated retries.

     ffiiffoo oovveerr//uunnddeerr--ffllooww..  The controller was unable to transfer data to the
     drive fast enough.  This usually occurs because a transfer was performed
     without using the controller's internal buffer.

     controller in data transferred between the drive and the controller's in-
     ternal buffer.

     pprroomm cchheecckkssuumm..  The controller thinks its PROM is corrupted.

     while looking for an inter-record gap.  This usually occurs because the
     records on the tape are larger than expected (or can be handled).

     ttaappee nnoott rreeaaddyy..  The drive does not respond; usually the power has been
     turned off or a cable has come off.

     wwrriittee pprrootteecctteedd..  A write ring was present in the tape when a write was
     attempted.

     iinnvvaalliidd lliinnkk ppooiinntteerr..  An invalid pointer was encountered in a tape pa-
     rameter block.

     uunneexxppeecctteedd ffiillee mmaarrkk..  A tape file mark was encountered while trying to
     read or space.

     iinnvvaalliidd bbyyttee ccoouunntt..  An invalid byte count parameter was encountered in a
     tape parameter block.

     yycc%%dd:: lloosstt iinntteerrrruupptt..  The controller failed to respond with an interrupt
     signifying completion of the current command.  The system will attempt to
     abort the outstanding command and reset the controller.

     ccyy%%dd:: rreesseett ffaaiilleedd..  The system was unable to reset the controller.  This
     is normally preceded by another message from the driver.

     The ccyy driver appeared in 4.3BSD-Tahoe.

     The controller supports only 20-bit addresses.  The only way the system
     can insure the controller will be able to address data to be transferred
     is to copy it into an intermediate buffer allocated in the first megabyte
     of system memory.
