     The console is available to the processor through the console registers.
     It acts like a normal terminal, except that a ``~~'' is used to transfer
     commands to the console processor when the front panel key switch is in
     the ``foo'' or ``bar'' position.  When the console processor is in con-
     trol, a `#>' prompt is displayed.  To continue execution after halting
     the machine with `~h', use `r'.

     ~~hh      Halt the machine.

     ~~bb      Force a reboot.

     ~~rr      Continue execution after a ~~hh.

     Refer to the Tahoe console processor handbook for the complete list of
     facilities available through the console processor.

     The CCPP device provides direct access to the console processor.  The
     rreemmoottee device is a secondary console terminal used for remote diagnosis;
     it is normally connected to a modem.
