     iinnttrroo - introduction to special files and hardware support

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This section describes the special files, related driver functions, and
     networking support available in the system.  In this part of the manual,
     the SYNOPSIS section of each configurable device gives a sample specifi-
     cation for use in constructing a system description for the config(8)
     program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the
     console and in the system error log _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s due to errors in
     device operation.

     Software support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware device
     may be supported with a character or block _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r, or it may be
     used within the networking subsystem and have a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r.
     Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file system
     of a special type; see physio(4) and mknod(8).  Network interfaces are
     indirectly accessed through the interprocess communication facilities
     provided by the system; see socket(2).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time and
     the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled into
     the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the autoconfiguration
     facilities in the system probe for the device on the VERSAbus and, if
     found, enable the software support for it.  If a VERSAbus device does not
     respond at autoconfiguration time it is not accessible at any time after-
     wards.  To enable a VERSAbus device which did not autoconfigure, the sys-
     tem will have to be rebooted.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in autoconf(4).

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of the system.
     Devices are indicated by their functional interface.  If second vendor
     products provide functionally identical interfaces they should be usable
     with the supplied software.  ((BBeewwaarree hhoowweevveerr tthhaatt wwee pprroommiissee tthhee ssooffttwwaarree
