     aauuttooccoonnff - diagnostics from autoconfiguration code

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     When UNIX bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine it is running
     on and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out what
     it finds on the console.  This procedure is driven by a system configura-
     tion table which is processed by config(8) and compiled into each kernel.

     VERSAbus devices are located by probing to see if their control-status
     registers respond.  If not, they are silently ignored.  If the control
     status register responds but the device cannot be made to interrupt, a
     diagnostic warning will be printed on the console and the device will not
     be available to the system.

     A generic system may be built which picks its root device at boot time as
     the ``best'' available device.  If such a system is booted with the
     RB_ASKNAME option of (see reboot(2)),  then the name of the root device
     is read from the console terminal at boot time, and any available device
     may be used.

     vvbbaa%%dd aatt %%xx..  A VERSAbus adapter was found and mapped into the address
     space of the operating system starting at virtual address `%x'. UNIX will
     call it `vba%d'.

     %%ss%%dd aatt vvbbaa%%dd ddrriivvee %%dd..  A tape formatter or a disk was found on the
     VERSAbus; for disks `%s%d' will look like `dk0', for tape formatters like
     `yc1'. The drive number comes from the unit plug on the drive or in the
     tape formatter (_n_o_t on the tape drive; see below).

     %%ss%%dd aatt %%ss%%dd ssllaavvee %%dd..  Which would look like `yc0 at cy0 slave 0%',
     where _y_c_0 is the name for the tape device and _c_y_0 is the name for the
     formatter.  A tape slave was found on the tape formatter at the indicated
     drive number (on the front of the tape drive).  UNIX will call the de-
     vice, e.g., cy0.

     found on `vba%d' at control-status register address `%x' and with device
     vector `%x'. The device interrupted at priority level `%x'.

     control-status register address `%x'; no interrupts were configured for
     the device.

     likely because it is broken, hung, or not the kind of device it is adver-
     tised to be.  The csr address is interpreted as described above.

     %%ss%%dd aatt %%ss%%dd ssllaavvee %%dd..  Which would look like `dk0 at vd0 slave 0', where
     _d_k_0 is the name of a disk drive and _v_d_0 is the name of the controller.

     Very few devices actually figure out their interrupt vector by forcing
     the device to interrupt.  Only the upper megabyte of the VERSAbus address
     space is mapped into the system's virtual address space.
