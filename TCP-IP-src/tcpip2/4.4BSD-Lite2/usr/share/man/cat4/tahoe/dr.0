     The ddrr driver provides access to an Ikon DR-11W DMA controller.  Each mi-
     nor device is a different controller.

     In addition to reading and writing, the following ioctl(2) requests are
     available:

     DRWAIT         Wait for an attention interrupt from the associated de-
                    vice.

     DRPIOW         Write to the programmed I/O register.

     DRPACL         Write to the pulse register.

     DRDACL         Set the ``ac-low'' bit in the next command sent to the
                    DR-11W.

     DRPCYL         Set the ``cycle'' bit in the next command sent to the
                    DR-11W.

     DRDFCN         Hold the function bits until the next command is issused.

     DRRATN         Reset the attention flag.

     DRRDMA         Reset the DMA complete flag.

     DRSFCN         Set the function bits in the control status register and,
                    as a side effect, clear the interrupt enable flag.

     DRRPER         Reset the parity error flag.

     DRSETRSTALL    Set ``no stall'' mode for all subsequent reads.  In no
                    stall mode the driver will abort read requests that fail
                    to complete before a user specified timeout expires.

     DRSETNORSTALL  Disable no stall mode for reads.

     DRGETRSTALL    Return true if in no stall mode for reads.

     DRSETRTIMEOUT  Set the value of the timeout used in no stall mode  for
                    reads.  The time is specified in tenths of seconds.

     DRGETRTIMEOUT  Return the time until (in tenths of seconds) before a read
                    is timed out when in no stall mode.

     DRSETWSTALL    Set ``no stall'' mode for all subsequent writes.  In no
                    stall mode the driver will abort write requests that fail
                    to complete before a user specified timeout expires.

     DRSETNOWSTALL  Disable no stall mode for writes.

     DRGETWSTALL    Return true if in no stall mode for writes.

     DRSETWTIMEOUT  Set the value of the timeout used in no stall mode  for
                    writes.  The time is specified in tenths of seconds.

     DRGETRTIMEOUT  Return the time until (in tenths of seconds) before a

                    write is timed out when in no stall mode.

     DRWRITEREADY   Return 1 if the device can accept data, 0 otherwise (this
                    is really the DR-11W A status bit).

     DRREADREADY    Return 1 if the device has data for the host to read, 0
                    otherwise (this is really the DR-11W B status bit).

     DRBUSY         Return 1  if the device is busy, 0 otherwise.

     DRRESET        Reset the DR-11W.

     DR11STAT       Return the driver status and the contents of the DR-11W
                    I/O registers. The eight words returned are, in order, the
                    driver status flags, the contents of the control status
                    register, the contents of the status register at the time
                    of the last interrupt from the device, the contents of the
                    programmed I/O data register, a combination of the address
                    modifier used by the device in performing VERSAbus trans-
                    fers and the interrupt vector used by the device, the con-
                    tents of the range register, the contents of the rahi reg-
                    ister, and the contents of the ralo register.

     DR11LOOP       Perform loopback testing (the loopback cable must be in
                    place for this to work).
