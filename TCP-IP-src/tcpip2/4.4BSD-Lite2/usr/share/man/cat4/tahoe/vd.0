     This is a generic VERSAbus storage module disk driver for the Computer
     Consoles SMD (VDDC) and SMD-E disk controllers.

     The vvdd driver is a fairly typical block I/O device, except raw block I/O
     counts must be a multiple of 1024 bytes, whether the actual sector size
     is 512 or 1024 bytes.  Likewise, seek calls should specify a multiple of
     1024 bytes.  See physio(4).

     The first sector of each disk contains a disk label containing geometry
     information and partition layouts (see disklabel(5)).  This sector is
     normally write-protected, and disk-to-disk copies should avoid copying
     this sector.  The label may be updated with disklabel(8),  which can also
     be used to write-enable and write-disable the sector.

DDIISSKK SSUUPPPPOORRTT
     During autoconfiguration, as well as when a drive is opened after all
     partitions are closed, the first sector of the drive is examined for a
     disk label.  If a label is found, the geometry of the drive and the par-
     tition tables are taken from it.  If no label is found, The driver checks
     for a disk label on sector 0 of each drive during autoconfiguration.  If
     no label is found, the driver tries to access the last track on each
     drive to determine the type of drive attached.  The driver has default
     partition tables for seven different drives: CDC FSD (160 MB), CDC 9766
     (300 MB), CDC XFSD (340 MB), CDC 515 MB, Fujitsu 360 MB, Fujitsu Eagle
     (440 MB), and Maxtor 340 MB. If the drive is not recognized, a single
     small partition is created to allow a label to be written.

     The partition tables in the disk label and the _d_i_s_k_t_a_b file specify par-
     tition offsets and sizes in sectors, which are 512 bytes on SMD drives
     and 1024 bytes on 5 1/4" ESDI drives.  By convention, the ?a partition is
     normally used for the root file system or other small file system, and
     the ?b partition is used as a paging area.  The ?c partition maps the
     rest of the pack, except the last 5 cylinders which are reserved for bad
     sector forwarding, and diagnostic use.

     configured.

     about to tell the controller to ``start'' the drives attached to  it.

     autoconfiguration the system prints a message of this form.  The drive
     type is displayed as well as the geometry: tracks/cylinder, cylinders,
     and sectors/track.

     controller after submitting a request.  The system attempts to abort the
     current request and simulate an interrupt to unwedge the controller.
     During processing of the simulated interrupt, a controller error will be
     reported as described below.

     filesystem block number reported is a logical sector number on the indi-
     cated partition; it is expressed using 1024-byte sectors.  If the trans-
     fer involved multiple blocks, the block range is printed as well.  The
     parenthesized fields list the actual disk sector number relative to the
     beginning of the drive (in 512- or 1024-byte blocks, as appropriate), as
     well as the cylinder, track and sector number of the block.  The error
     status field of the device control block is printed in hexadecimal fol-
     lowed by a symbolic description.  If this is an SMDE controller, the er-
     ror code is also displayed.

     Writes scribble on the tail of incomplete blocks.

     The system should use real disk sector numbers internally, instead of as-
     suming 1024-byte sectors; errors should report filesystem block numbers
     using the actual sector size.  Raw I/O should be permitted on any sector
     boundary.
