     ccrrll - VAX 8600 console RL02 interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a simple interface to the DEC RL02 disk unit which is part of the
     console subsystem on the VAX 8600 and 8650.  Access is given to the en-
     tire RL02 disk; the pack format is the same as that of RL02 disks on oth-
     er controllers.  As on other VAX console media, transfers are done a word
     at a time using privileged registers (i.e., slowly).

     All I/O is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should be a multiple
     of 512 bytes and a multiple of 512 bytes should be transferred, as in
     other ``raw'' disk interfaces.  (Although the sector size is actually 256
     bytes, the driver allows operations only on 512-byte boundaries.)
