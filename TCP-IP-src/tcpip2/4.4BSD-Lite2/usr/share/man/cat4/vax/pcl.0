     The ppccll device provides an IP-only interface to the DEC CSS PCL-11 time
     division multiplexed network bus.  The controller itself is not accessi-
     ble to users.

     The hosts's address is specified with the SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2).  The in-
     terface will not transmit or receive any data before its address is de-
     fined.

     As the PCL-11 hardware is only capable of having 15 interfaces per net-
     work, a single-byte host-on-network number is used, with range [1..15] to
     match the TDM bus addresses of the interfaces.

     The interface currently only supports the Internet protocol family and
     only provides ``natural'' (header) encapsulation.

     ppccll%%dd:: ccaann''tt iinniitt..  Insufficient UNIBUS resources existed to initialize
     the device.  This is likely to occur when the device is run on a buffered
     data path on an 11/750 and other network interfaces are also configured
     to use buffered data paths, or when it is configured to use buffered data
     paths on an 11/730 (which has none).

     ppccll%%dd:: ccaann''tt hhaannddllee aaff%%dd..  The interface was handed a message with ad-
     dresses formatted in an unsuitable address family;  the packet was
     dropped.

     ppccll%%dd:: ssttrraayy xxmmiitt iinntteerrrruupptt..  An interrupt occurred when no output had
     previously been started.

     ppccll%%dd:: mmaasstteerr..  The TDM bus had no station providing ``bus master'' tim-
     ing signals, so this interface has assumed the ``master'' role.  This
     message should only appear at most once per UNIBUS INIT on a single sys-
     tem.  Unless there is a hardware failure, only one station may be master
     at at time.

     ppccll%%dd:: sseenndd eerrrroorr,, ttccrr==%%bb,, ttssrr==%%bb..  The device indicated a problem send-
     ing data on output.  If a ``receiver offline'' error is detected, it is
     not normally logged unless the option PCL_TESTING has been selected, as
     this causes a lot of console chatter when sending to a down machine.
     However, this option is quite useful when debugging problems with the PCL
     interfaces.

     ing data on input.

     ppccll%%dd:: bbaadd lleenn==%%dd..  An input operation resulted in a data transfer of
     less than 0 or more than 1008 bytes of data into memory (according to the
     word count register).  This should never happen as the maximum size of a
     PCL message has been agreed upon to be 1008 bytes (same as ArpaNet mes-
     sage).
