     The llpp device supports DEC and DEC compatible printers on the LP-11 par-
     allel interface.

     The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor device after re-
     moving the low 3 bits, which act as per-device parameters.  Currently on-
     ly the lowest of the low three bits is interpreted: if it is set, the de-
     vice is assumed to have a 64-character set or half-ASCII mode, rather
     than a full 96-character set.

     If the 64-character set is assumed, any lower case characters are mapped
     to upper case; left curly and right curly braces are mapped to left and
     right parentheses over laid with a hyphen; grave accents are mapped to
     acute accents with overlaid with a hyphen; the pipe bar character is
     mapped to an exclamation sign overlaid with a hyphen; and the tilde char-
     acter is mapped to a carat overlaid with a hyphen.

     The default page width is 132 columns; longer lines are truncated.  This
     may be overridden by specifying, for example, `flags 256'.
