     The hhyy interface provides access to a Network Systems Corporation Hyper-
     channel Adapter.

     The network to which the interface is attached is specified at boot time
     with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2).  The host's address is discovered by read-
     ing the adapter status register.  The interface will not transmit or re-
     ceive packets until the network number is known.

     If the adapter does not respond to the status command issued during auto-
     configure, the adapter is assumed down.  A reboot is required to recog-
     nize it.

     The adapter power fail interrupt seems to occur sporadically when power
     has, in fact, not failed.  The driver will believe that power has failed
     only if it can not reset the power fail latch after a ``reasonable'' time
     interval.  These seem to appear about 2-4 times a day on some machines.
     There seems to be no correlation with adapter rev level, number of ports
     used etc. and whether a machine will get these ``bogus powerfails''. They
     don't seem to cause any real problems so they have been ignored.
