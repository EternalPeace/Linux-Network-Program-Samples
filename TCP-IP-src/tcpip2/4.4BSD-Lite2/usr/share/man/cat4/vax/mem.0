     mmeemm, kkmmeemm, kkUUmmeemm - memory files

     The special file //ddeevv//mmeemm is an interface to the physical memory of the
     computer.  Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory
     addresses.  Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and
     writing memory itself.  Only offsets within the bounds of //ddeevv//mmeemm are
     allowed.

     Kernel virtual memory is accessed through the interface //ddeevv//kkmmeemm in the
     same manner as //ddeevv//mmeemm. Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently
     mapped to memory are allowed.

     The file //ddeevv//kkUUmmeemm also refers to kernel virtual memory, but may be used
     to access areas mapped to UNIBUS address space and other I/O areas.  It
     forces all accesses to use word (short integer) accesses.

     On the VAX 11/780, the I/O space base address is 20000000(16); on an
     11/750 the I/O space addresses are of the form fxxxxx(16). On all VAX'en
     the per-process data size for the current process is UPAGES long and ends
     at the virtual address 80000000(16).

     The mmeemm, kkmmeemm files appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The file kkUUmmeemm ap-
     peared in 3.0BSD.
