     The hhkk driver is a typical block-device disk driver; block device I/O is
     described in physio(4).

     The script MAKEDEV(8) should be used to create the special files; if a
     special file needs to be created by hand consult mknod(8).

     Special file names begin with `hk' and `rhk' for the block and character
     files respectively. The second component of the name, a drive unit number
     in the range of zero to seven, is represented by a `?' in the disk lay-
     outs below. The last component is the file system partition which is des-
     ignated by a letter from `a' to `h'. and corresponds to a minor device
     number set: zero to seven, eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for drive
     zero, drive two and drive three respectively.  The location and size (in
     sectors) of the partitions for the RK06 and RK07 drives are as follows:

     RK07 partitions:

               hk?c     0            27126     0-410

     On a dual RK-07 system partition hk?a is used for the root for one drive
     and partition hk?g for the /usr file system.  If large jobs are to be run
     using hk?b on both drives as swap area provides a 10Mbyte paging area.
     Otherwise partition hk?c on the other drive is used as a single large
     file system.

     able error occurred during transfer of the specified filesystem block
     number(s), which are logical block numbers on the indicated partition.
     The contents of the cs2, ds and er registers are printed in octal and
     symbolically with bits decoded.  The error was either unrecoverable, or a
     large number of retry attempts (including offset positioning and drive
     recalibration) could not recover the error.

     ing the message about being not ready (which takes a fraction of a sec-
     ond) was ready.  The operation is recovered if no further errors occur.

     on the specified sector(s) in the specified disk partition.  This happens
     normally a few times a week.  If it happens more frequently than this the
     sectors where the errors are occurring should be checked to see if cer-
     tain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive or heads
     are indicated.

     rupt for an extended period while an operation was outstanding.  This in-
     dicates a hardware or software failure.  There is currently a hard-
     ware/software problem with spinning down drives while they are being ac-
     cessed which causes this error to occur.  The error causes a UNIBUS re-
     set, and retry of the pending operations.  If the controller continues to
     lose interrupts, this error will recur a few seconds later.

     The write function scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.

     DEC-standard error logging should be supported.

     A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its present
     reduced form) is needed.

     The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
     pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
     and this would make packs more portable.

     The RK07 g partition size in rk.c disagrees with that in _/_e_t_c_/_d_i_s_k_t_a_b_.
