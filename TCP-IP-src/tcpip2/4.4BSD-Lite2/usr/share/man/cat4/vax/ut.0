     The uutt interface provides access to a standard tape drive interface as
     describe in mtio(4).  Hardware implementing this on the VAX is typified
     by the System Industries SI 9700 tape subsystem.  Tapes may be read or
     written at 800, 1600, and 6250 BPI.

     ttjj%%dd:: nnoo wwrriittee rriinngg..  An attempt was made to write on the tape drive when
     no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of the
     user who tried to access the tape.

     ttjj%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee..  An attempt was made to access the tape while it was
     offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to
     access the tape.

     a tape at a different density than is already recorded on the tape.  This
     message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to switch the
     density.

     a corrected error at a density other than 800bpi.  The data transferred
     is assumed to be correct.

     at block

     bbnn..  Any error is fatal on non-raw tape; when possible the driver will
     have retried the operation which failed several times before reporting
     the error.

     ttjj%%dd:: lloosstt iinntteerrrruupptt..  A tape operation did not complete within a reason-
     able time, most likely because the tape was taken off-line during rewind
     or lost vacuum.  The controller should, but does not, give an interrupt
     in these cases.  The device will be made available again after this mes-
     sage, but any current open reference to the device will return an error
     as the operation in progress aborts.
