     The ttuu interface provides access to the VAX 11/730 and 11/750 TU58 con-
     sole cassette drive(s).

     The interface supports only block I/O to the TU58 cassettes.  The devices
     are normally manipulated with the arff(8) program using the ``f'' and
     ``m'' options.

     The device driver is automatically included when a system is configured
     to run on an 11/730 or 11/750.

     The TU58 on an 11/750 uses the Radial Serial Protocol (RSP) to communi-
     cate with the cpu over a serial line.  This protocol is inherently unre-
     liable as it has no flow control measures built in.  On an 11/730 the
     Modified Radial Serial Protocol is used.  This protocol incorporates flow
     control measures which insure reliable data transfer between the cpu and
     the device.  Certain 11/750's have been modified to use the MRSP prom
     used in the 11/730.  To reliably use the console TU58 on an 11/750 under
     UNIX, the MRSP prom is required.  For those 11/750's without an MRSP
     prom, an unreliable but often useable interface has been developed.  This
     interface uses an assembly language ``pseudo-dma'' routine to minimize
     the receiver interrupt service latency.  To include this code in the sys-
     tem, the configuration must _n_o_t specify the system will run on an 11/730
     or use an MRSP prom.  This unfortunately makes it impossible to configure
     a single system which will properly handle TU58's on both an 11/750 and
     an 11/730 (unless both machines have MRSP proms).

     usually indicates that one or more receiver interrupts were lost and the
     transfer is restarted (11/750 only).

     The VAX-11/750 console interface without MRSP prom is unuseable while the
     system is multi-user; it should be used only with the system running sin-
     gle-user and, even then, with caution.
