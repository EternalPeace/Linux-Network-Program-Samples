     The nnpp device provides access to an Interlan Np100 Ethernet interface for
     control functions.

     This interface is unusual in that it requires loading firmware into the
     controller before it may be used as a network link-level interface.  This
     is accomplished by opening a character special device, and writing data
     to it.  It is also possible to do post-mortem debugging of firmware fail-
     ures by reading the local memory of the device.

     Multiple control processes are allowed by opening separate minor devices;
     secondary interfaces are specified by shifting the interface number by 4
     bits.

     The device also responds to commands passed through the driver by the
     following ioctl(2)s:

     NPRESET    kills off all active network processes.

     NPSTART    begins execution of the board at the specified address (usual-
                ly 0x400).

     NPNETBOOT  downloads the image from a server on the network.  [Contact
                MICOM-INTERLAN for details.]

     write operation causing it to run out of buffers before it finished the
     operation.  This indicates a kernel failure rather than a device failure.

     that the unibus address expected for the board was found to be bad.
     Probably indicates hardware problems with the board, as do the following:

     to have the vax print it out.

     it did not understand.

     resource to be exhausted.  This should never happen.

     There are 110 other diagnostic messages that can be enabled by setting
     bits in a debugging mask.  Consult the driver for details.
