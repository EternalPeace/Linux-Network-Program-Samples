     ccoonnss - VAX-11 console interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The console is available to the processor through the console registers.
     It acts like a normal terminal, except that when the local functions are
     not disabled, ^^PP (control-P) puts the console in local console mode
     (where the prompt is `>>>'). The operation of the console in this mode
     varies slightly per-processor.

     On either the VAX 11/780 or 785 the following commands may be used after
     placing the console in local mode with ^^PP.

         cc
         ccoonnttiinnuuee  Re-enter conversational mode if the processor was halted.

         hh
         hhaalltt      Halt the CPU.  On an 11/780 or 785 the processor is not
                   stopped by entering local console mode.

         sseett tt pp   (set terminal program) Re-enter conversational mode if the
                   processor is still running.

         PP         (proceed) Get out of ODT mode.

         <<bbrreeaakk>>   If you hit the break key on the console, then the console
                   LSI-11 will go into ODT (console debugger mode).

   TTnn VVAAXX NNoo 1111//775500 oorr 1111//773300
     On an 11/750 or an 11/730 the processor is halted whenever the console is
     not in conversational mode.

         CC         Return to conversational mode.

         rreett       Return from remote diagnosis mode to local console mode.

         ^^DD        (11/750 only) When in console mode on an 11/750 which has a
                   remote diagnosis module, a ^^DD will put you in remote diag-
                   nosis mode, where the prompt will be

     The VAX 8600 (8650) console normally works in the same way as the 11/750,
     except that there are many additional modes and commands.

         cc
         ccoonnttiinnuuee  Return to conversational mode.

         hhaalltt      Halt the processor if HEX debug enabled.

         pp         Halt the processor if in normal mode.

     With the above proviso's the console works like any other UNIX terminal.
