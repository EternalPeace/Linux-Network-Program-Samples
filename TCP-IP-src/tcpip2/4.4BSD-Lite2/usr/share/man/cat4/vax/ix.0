     The iixx interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through an
     Interlan Np100 controller used as a link-layer interface.

     This interface is unusual in that it requires loading firmware into the
     controller before it may be used as a network interface.  This is accom-
     plished by opening a character special device, and writing data to it.  A
     program to load the image is provided in _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c_/_n_e_w_/_n_p_1_0_0. The sequence
     of commands would be:

           # ./npload np.image [/dev/np<board #> if other than np00]
           # sleep 10
           # ifconfig ix0 ...

     Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
     SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2).  The iixx interface employs the address resolution
     protocol described in arp(4) to dynamically map between Internet and Eth-
     ernet addresses on the local network.

     The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsulation to mini-
     mize copying data on input and output.  The use of trailers is negotiated
     with ARP. This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis, by
     setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     controller refused to honor a request from UNIX in initializing packet
     level communications.  The board may need to be reset and reloaded.  Or,
     you may not have allowed enough time between loading the board and issu-
     ing the request to begin unix network operation.

     attempting to reprogram its physical ethernet address.  Try reloading the
     firmware.  The attempt is made only when this interfaces is not the first
     one configured for XNS.

     dresses formatted in an unsuitable address family; the packet was
     dropped.

     reloaded while network processes are still running.

     is made at an inopportune time, such as not allowing enough time after
     loading the firmware.  After 100 such errors are logged, the unix network
     driver will shut itself down, saying:

     and allow more time.
