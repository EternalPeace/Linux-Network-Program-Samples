     The vvvv interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Proteon proNET ring net-
     work.

     The network address of the interface must be specified with an an
     SIOCSIFADDR ioctl(2) before data can be transmitted or received.  It is
     only permissible to change the network address while the interface is
     marked ``down''.

     The host's hardware address is discovered by putting the interface in
     digital loopback mode (not joining the ring) and sending a broadcast
     packet from which the hardware address is extracted.

     Transmit timeouts are detected through use of a watchdog routine.  Lost
     input interrupts are checked for when packets are sent out.

     If the installation is running CTL boards which use the old broadcast ad-
     dress of `0' instead of the new address of `0xff', the define
     OLD_BROADCAST should be specified in the driver.

     The driver can use ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying data on
     input and output.  This may be disabled, on a per-interface basis, by
     setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.

     The vvvv driver appeared in 4.2BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     The encapsulation of trailer packets in the 4.2BSD version of this driver
     was incorrect (the packet type was in VAX byte order).  As a result, the
     trailer encapsulation in this version is not compatible with the 4.2BSD
     VAX version.
