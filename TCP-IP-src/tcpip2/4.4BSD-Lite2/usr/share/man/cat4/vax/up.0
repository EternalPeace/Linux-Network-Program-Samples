     This is a generic UNIBUS storage module disk driver.  It is specifically
     designed to work with the Emulex SC-21 and SC-31 controllers.  It can be
     easily adapted to other controllers (although bootstrapping will not nec-
     essarily be directly possible.)

     The script MAKEDEV(8) should be used to create the uupp special files; con-
     sult mknod(8) if a special file needs to be made manually.  It is recom-
     mended as a security precaution to not create special files for devices
     which may never be installed.

     The driver interrogates the controller's holding register to determine
     the type of drive attached.  The driver recognizes seven different
     drives: CDC 9762, CDC 9766, AMPEX DM980, AMPEX 9300, AMPEX Capricorn,
     FUJITSU 160, and FUJITSU Eagle (the Eagle is not supported by the SC-21).

     Special file names begin with `up' and `rup' for the block and character
     files respectively. The second component of the name, a drive unit number
     in the range of zero to seven, is represented by a `?' in the disk lay-
     outs below. The last component of the name, the file system partition, is
     designated by a letter from `a' to `h' which also corresponds to a minor
     device number set: zero to seven, eight to 15, 16 to 23 and so forth for
     drive zero, drive two and drive three respectively (see physio(4)).  The
     location and size (in 512 byte sectors) of the partitions for the above
     drives:

     The up?a partition is normally used for the root file system, the up?b
     partition as a paging area, and the up?c partition for pack-pack copying
     (it maps the entire disk).  On 160M drives the up?g partition maps the
     rest of the pack.  On other drives both up?g and up?h are used to map the
     remaining cylinders.

     number(s), which are logical block numbers on the indicated partition.
     The contents of the cs2, er1 and er2 registers are printed in octal and
     symbolically with bits decoded.  The error was either unrecoverable, or a
     large number of retry attempts (including offset positioning and drive
     recalibration) could not recover the error.

     on the specified sector of the specified disk partition.  This happens
     normally a few times a week.  If it happens more frequently than this the

     tain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive or heads
     are indicated.

     cessed which causes this error to occur.  The error causes a UNIBUS re-
     set, and retry of the pending operations.  If the controller continues to
     lose interrupts, this error will recur a few seconds later.

BBUUGGSS
     A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its present
     reduced form) is needed.

     The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
     pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
     and this would make packs more portable.
