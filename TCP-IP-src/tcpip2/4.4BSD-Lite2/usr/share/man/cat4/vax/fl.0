     ffll - console floppy interface

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a simple interface to the DEC RX01 floppy disk unit, which is
     part of the console LSI-11 subsystem for VAX-11/780s. Access is given to
     the entire floppy consisting of 77 tracks of 26 sectors of 128 bytes.

     All I/O is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should be a multiple
     of 128 bytes and a multiple of 128 bytes should be transferred, as in
     other ``raw'' disk interfaces.

     The ffll driver appeared in 4.0BSD.

     Multiple console floppies are not supported.

     If a write is given with a count not a multiple of 128 bytes then the
     trailing portion of the last sector will be zeroed.
