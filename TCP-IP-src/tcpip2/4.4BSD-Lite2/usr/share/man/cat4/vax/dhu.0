     A DHU-11 provides 16 communication lines.

     An optional argument _f_l_a_g_s may be supplied with the device specification
     in the config file indicating that the line corresponding to bit number _i
     is not properly connected, and should be treated as hard-wired with car-
     rier always present.  Thus specifying `flags 0x0004' for dhu0 would cause
     line _t_t_y_S_2 to be treated in this way.

     Normal I/O control parameters for individual lines are managed by
     ioctl(2) calls.  Individual DHU-11 lines may be configured to run at any
     of 13 speeds (50, 200 and 38400 baud are not available); the speed may be
     set via getty(8) or stty(1) or may be communicated by other programs
     which utilize ioctl such as ifcongif(8),  see tty(4).

     The DHU-11 driver normally uses input silos and delays receiver inter-
     rupts by 20 milliseconds rather than taking an interrupt on each input
     character.

     ddhhuu((%%dd,,%%dd)):: NNXXMM ffaauulltt..  No response from UNIBUS on a DMA transfer within
     a timeout period.  This is often followed by a UNIBUS adapter error.
     This occurs most frequently when the UNIBUS is heavily loaded and when
     devices which hog the bus (such as RK07s) are present.  It is not seri-
     ous.

     ddhhuu%%dd:: ssiilloo oovveerrffllooww..  The character input silo overflowed before it
     could be serviced.  This can happen if a hard error occurs when the CPU
     is running with elevated priority, as the system may then print a message
     on the console with interrupts disabled.

NNOOTTEESS
     The driver currently does not make full use of the hardware capabilities
     of the DHU-11, for dealing with XON/XOFF flow-control or hard-wired lines
     for example.

     Although the devices are not the same, a DHU-11 can convince the DH-11
     autoconfiguration code that it is a DH-11.

     The 4 40-way cables are a pain.
