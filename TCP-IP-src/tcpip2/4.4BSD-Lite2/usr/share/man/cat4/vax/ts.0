     The TS-11 combination provides a standard tape drive interface as de-
     scribed in mtio(4).  The TS-11 operates only at 1600 BPI, and only one
     transport is possible per controller.

     no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of the
     user who tried to access the tape.

     offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to
     access the tape.

     bits.

     May hang ungracefully if a physical error (non-data) occurs.

     The device lives at the same address as a TM-11 (tm(4));  as it is very
     difficult to get this device to interrupt, a generic system assumes that
     a ttss is present whenever no TM-11 exists but the CSR responds and a TS-11
     is configured.  This does no harm as long as a non-existent TS-11 is not
     accessed.
