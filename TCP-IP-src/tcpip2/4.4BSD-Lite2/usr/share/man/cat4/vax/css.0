     The ccssss device provides a Local Host/Distant Host interface to an IMP. It
     is normally used when participating in the DARPA Internet.  The con-
     troller itself is not accessible to users, but instead provides the hard-
     ware support to the IMP interface described in imp(4).  The configuration
     entry for the imp must also include the _p_s_e_u_d_o_-_d_e_v_i_c_e as shown above.

     device did not autoconfigure.  This is indicates a system problem.

     ccssss%%dd:: ccaann''tt iinniittiiaalliizzee..  Insufficient UNIBUS resources existed to ini-
     tialize the device.  This is likely to occur when the device is run on a
     buffered data path on an 11/750 and other network interfaces are also
     configured to use buffered data paths, or when it is configured to use
     buffered data paths on an 11/730 (which has none).

     the device, but the IMP failed to respond after 500 tries.  Check the ca-
     bling.

     put had previously been started.

     sending data on output.

     on input.

     ccssss%%dd:: bbaadd lleennggtthh==%%dd..  An input operation resulted in a data transfer of
     less than 0 or more than 1008 bytes of data into memory (according to the
     word count register).  This should never happen as the maximum size of a
     host-IMP message is 1008 bytes.

     The ccssss interface appeared in 4.2BSD.
