     This section describes the special files, related driver functions, and
     networking support available in the system.  In this part of the manual,
     the SYNOPSIS section of each configurable device gives a sample specifi-
     cation for use in constructing a system description for the config(8)
     program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the
     console and/or in the system error log _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s due to errors in
     device operation; see syslogd(8) for more information.

     This section describes the hardware supported on the DEC VAX-11. Software
     support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware device may be
     supported with a character or block _d_e_v_i_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r, or it may be used
     within the networking subsystem and have a _n_e_t_w_o_r_k _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e _d_r_i_v_e_r.
     Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file system
     of a special type; see physio(4) and mknod(8).  Network interfaces are
     indirectly accessed through the interprocess communication facilities
     provided by the system; see socket(2).

     A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time and
     the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled into
     the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the autoconfiguration
     facilities in the system probe for the device on either the UNIBUS (or Q-
     bus) or MASSBUS and, if found, enable the software support for it.  If a
     UNIBUS device does not respond at autoconfiguration time it is not acces-
     sible at any time afterwards.  To enable a UNIBUS device which did not
     autoconfigure, the system will have to be rebooted.  If a MASSBUS device
     comes ``on-line'' after the autoconfiguration sequence it will be dynami-
     cally autoconfigured into the running system.

     The autoconfiguration system is described in autoconf(4).  A list of the
     supported devices is given below.

     The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of the system.
     Pseudo-devices are not listed.  Devices are indicated by their functional
     interface.  If second vendor products provide functionally identical
     interfaces they should be usable with the supplied software.  BBeewwaarree,,

     a similar type may be added simply by creating appropriate table entries
     in the driver.
