     The TM-03 transport combination provides a standard tape drive interface
     as described in mtio(4).  All drives provide both 800 and 1600 BPI; the
     TE-16 runs at 45 IPS, the TU-45 at 75 IPS, while the TU-77 runs at 125
     IPS and autoloads tapes.

     no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of the
     user who tried to access the tape.

     ttuu%%dd:: nnoott oonnlliinnee..  An attempt was made to access the tape while it was
     offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to
     access the tape.

     a tape at a different density than is already recorded on the tape.  This
     message is written on the terminal of the user who tried to switch the
     density.

     block _b_n; the ht error register and drive status register are printed in
     octal with the bits symbolically decoded.  Any error is fatal on non-raw
     tape; when possible the driver will have retried the operation which
     failed several times before reporting the error.
