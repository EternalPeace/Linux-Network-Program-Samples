       _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e  plays  the  card game cribbage, with the program
       playing one hand and the user the other.  The program will
       initially ask the user if the rules of the game are needed
       - if so, it will print out the  appropriate  section  from
       _A_c_c_o_r_d_i_n_g _t_o _H_o_y_l_e with _m_o_r_e _(_I_)_.

       _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e options include:

       --ee     When the player makes a mistake scoring his hand or
              crib, provide an explanation of the correct  score.
              (This  is especially useful for beginning players.)

       --qq     Print a shorter form of all messages - this is only
              recommended  for  users  who  have  played the game
              without specifying this option.

       --rr     Instead of asking the player to cut the  deck,  the
              program will randomly cut the deck.

       _C_r_i_b_b_a_g_e first asks the player whether he wishes to play a
       short game ("once around", to 61) or a long  game  ("twice
       around",  to  121).   A  response  of `s' will result in a
       short game, any other response will play a long game.

       At the start of the  first  game,  the  program  asks  the
       player  to  cut  the  deck to determine who gets the first
       crib.  The user should respond with a number between 0 and
       51,  indicating how many cards down the deck is to be cut.
       The player who cuts the lower ranked card gets  the  first
       crib.   If  more than one game is played, the loser of the
       previous game gets the first crib in the current game.

       For each hand, the program first prints the player's hand,
       whose  crib it is, and then asks the player to discard two
       cards into the crib.  The cards are prompted for  one  per
       line, and are typed as explained below.

       After  discarding, the program cuts the deck (if it is the
       player's crib) or asks the player to cut the deck (if it's
       its crib); in the latter case, the appropriate response is
       a number from 0 to 39 indicating how far down the  remain-
       ing 40 cards are to be cut.

       After  cutting  the  deck, play starts with the non-dealer

       (the person who doesn't have the crib) leading  the  first
       card.   Play  continues,  as per cribbage, until all cards
       are exhausted.  The program keeps track of the scoring  of
       all points and the total of the cards on the table.

       After  play,  the  hands are scored.  The program requests
       the player to score his hand (and the crib, if it is  his)
       by  printing  out  the appropriate cards (and the cut card
       enclosed in brackets).  Play continues  until  one  player
       reaches the game limit (61 or 121).

       A  carriage  return  when  a  numeric input is expected is
       equivalent to typing the lowest legal value; when  cutting
       the deck this is equivalent to choosing the top card.

       Cards  are  specified as rank followed by suit.  The ranks
       may be specified as one of: `a', `2', `3', `4', `5',  `6',
       `7',  `8',  `9', `t', `j', `q', and `k', or alternatively,
       one of: "ace",  "two",  "three",  "four",  "five",  "six",
       "seven",  "eight",  "nine",  "ten",  "jack",  "queen", and
       "king".  Suits may be specified as:  `s',  `h',  `d',  and
       `c',  or alternatively as: "spades", "hearts", "diamonds",
       and "clubs".  A card may  be  specified  as:  <rank>  "  "
       <suit>,  or:  <rank>  " of " <suit>.  If the single letter
       rank and suit designations are used, the space  separating
       the suit and rank may be left out.  Also, if only one card
       of the desired rank is playable, typing the rank is suffi-
       cient.  For example, if your hand was "2H, 4D, 5C, 6H, JC,
       KD" and it was desired to discard the  king  of  diamonds,
       any of the following could be typed: "k", "king", "kd", "k
       d", "k of d", "king d", "king of d", "k diamonds",  "k  of
       diamonds", "king diamonds", or "king of diamonds".
