       _M_o_n_o_p   is   reminiscent  of  the  Parker  Brother's  game
       Monopoly, and monitors a game between 1 to 9 users.  It is
       assumed  that  the  rules of Monopoly are known.  The game
       follows the standard rules, with the exception that, if  a
       property  goes  up for auction and there are only two sol-
       vent players, no auction is held and the property  remains
       unowned.

       The game, in effect, lends the player money, so it is pos-
       sible to buy something which you cannot afford.   However,
       as soon as a person goes into debt, he must "fix the prob-
       lem", _i_._e_., make himself solvent,  before  play  can  con-
       tinue.   If  this  is  not possible, the player's property
       reverts to his debtee, either a player  or  the  bank.   A
       player  can  resign at any time to any person or the bank,
       which puts the property back on the board, unowned.

       Any time that the response to  a  question  is  a  _s_t_r_i_n_g,
       e.g.,  a  name, place or person, you can type `?' to get a
       list of valid answers.  It is not possible to input a neg-
       ative number, nor is it ever necessary.

       _A _S_u_m_m_a_r_y _o_f _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s:
       _q_u_i_t:     quit game: This allows you to quit the game.  It
                 asks you if you're sure.
       _p_r_i_n_t:    print board: This prints out the current  board.
                 The  columns have the following meanings (column
                 headings are the same for the wwhheerree,  oowwnn  hhoolldd--
                 iinnggss, and hhoollddiinnggss commands):
                 Name  The  first  ten  characters of the name of
                       the square
                 Own   The _n_u_m_b_e_r of the owner of the property.
                 Price The cost of the property (if any)
                 Mg    This field has a `*' in it if the property
                       is mortgaged
                 #     If  the property is a Utility or Railroad,
                       this is the number of such  owned  by  the
                       owner.   If  the property is land, this is
                       the number of houses on it.
                 Rent  Current rent on the property.   If  it  is
                       not owned, there is no rent.
       _w_h_e_r_e:    where players are: Tells you where all the play-
                 ers are.  A `*' indicates the current player.

       _o_w_n _h_o_l_d_i_n_g_s:
                 List your own holdings, _i_._e_., money, get-out-of-
                 jail-free cards, and property.
       _h_o_l_d_i_n_g_s: holdings  list:  Look  at anyone's holdings.  It
                 will ask you whose holdings you wish to look at.
                 When you are finished, type "done".
       _m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e: mortgage  property:  Sets up a list of mortgage-
                 able property, and asks which you wish to  mort-
                 gage.
       _u_n_m_o_r_t_g_a_g_e:
                 unmortgage  property: Unmortgage mortgaged prop-
                 erty.
       _b_u_y:      buy houses: Sets up  a  list  of  monopolies  on
                 which you can buy houses.  If there is more than
                 one, it asks you which you want to buy for.   It
                 then  asks  you how many for each piece of prop-
                 erty, giving the current amount  in  parentheses
                 after  the  property  name.   If you build in an
                 unbalanced manner (a disparity of more than  one
                 house  within the same monopoly), it asks you to
                 re-input things.
       _s_e_l_l:     sell houses: Sets up a list of  monopolies  from
                 which  you  can  sell houses.  It operates in an
                 analogous manner to _b_u_y_.
       _c_a_r_d:     card for jail: Use a  get-out-of-jail-free  card
                 to  get  out of jail.  If you're not in jail, or
                 you don't have one, it tells you so.
       _p_a_y:      pay for jail: Pay $50 to get out of  jail,  from
                 whence  you are put on Just Visiting.  Difficult
                 to do if you're not there.
       _t_r_a_d_e:    This allows you to trade  with  another  player.
                 It  asks  you  whom  you wish to trade with, and
                 then asks you what each wishes to give up.   You
                 can get a summary at the end, and, in all cases,
                 it asks for confirmation  of  the  trade  before
                 doing it.
       _r_e_s_i_g_n:   Resign  to  another  player or the bank.  If you
                 resign to the bank, all property reverts to  its
                 virgin  state,  and  get-out-of-jail  free cards
                 revert to the deck.
       _s_a_v_e:     save game: Save the current game in a  file  for
                 later play.  You can continue play after saving,
                 either by adding the file in which you saved the
                 game  after  the  _m_o_n_o_p command, or by using the
                 _r_e_s_t_o_r_e command (see below).  It  will  ask  you
                 which  file  you wish to save it in, and, if the
                 file exists, confirm that you wish to  overwrite
                 it.
       _r_e_s_t_o_r_e:  restore  game:  Read  in a previously saved game
                 from a file.  It leaves the file intact.
       _r_o_l_l:     Roll the dice  and  move  forward  to  your  new
