       If  you  have  never played solitaire before, it is recom-
       mended that you consult a solitaire instruction  book.  In
       Canfield,  tableau  cards may be built on each other down-
       ward in alternate colors. An entire pile must be moved  as
       a  unit  in building. Top cards of the piles are available
       to be played on foundations, but never into empty  spaces.

       Spaces  must be filled from the stock. The top card of the
       stock also is available to be  played  on  foundations  or
       built  on  tableau  piles.  After  the stock is exhausted,
       tableau spaces may be filled from the talon and the player
       may keep them open until he wishes to use them.

       Cards  are  dealt from the hand to the talon by threes and
       this repeats until there are no more cards in the hand  or
       the  player  quits. To have cards dealt onto the talon the
       player types 'ht' for his move. Foundation base cards  are
       also  automatically  moved  to  the  foundation  when they
       become available.

       The command 'c' causes _c_a_n_f_i_e_l_d to maintain card  counting
       statistics  on  the  bottom  of the screen.  When properly
       used this can greatly increase one's chances of winning.

       The rules for betting are somewhat less strict than  those
       used  in  the  official  version of the game.  The initial
       deal costs $13.  You may quit at this point or inspect the
       game.  Inspection costs $13 and allows you to make as many
       moves as possible without moving any cards from your  hand
       to the talon.  (The initial deal places three cards on the
       talon; if all these cards are used, three  more  are  made
       available.)   Finally,  if the game seems interesting, you
       must pay the final installment of $26.  At this point  you
       are  credited at the rate of $5 for each card on the foun-
       dation; as the game progresses you are  credited  with  $5
       for  each  card that is moved to the foundation.  Each run
       through the hand after  the  first  costs  $5.   The  card
       counting  feature  costs  $1 for each unknown card that is
       identified.  If the information is  toggled  on,  you  are
       only  charged  for  cards that became visible since it was
       last turned on.  Thus the maximum cost of  information  is
       $34.   Playing time is charged at a rate of $1 per minute.
