       This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
       or against a "friend".  All commands only are one  letter,
       so you don't need to type a carriage return, except at the
       end of a move.  The program is mostly self documenting, so
       that  a  question mark (?) will usually get some help.  If
       you answer `y' when the  program  asks  if  you  want  the
       rules, you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
       some hints on strategy, instruction on how to use the pro-
       gram, and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against
       the computer.  A description of how to use the program can
       be  obtained  by  answering  `y'  when it asks if you want
       instructions.

       The possible arguments for backgammon (most  are  unneces-
       sary but some are very convenient) consist of:


       nn       don't ask for rules or instructions

       rr       player is red (implies n)

       ww       player is white (implies n)

       bb       two players, red and white (implies n)

       pprr      print the board before red's turn

       ppww      print the board before white's turn

       ppbb      print the board before both player's turn

       tt_t_e_r_m   terminal is type _t_e_r_m, uses /etc/termcap

       ss_f_i_l_e   recover previously saved game from _f_i_l_e.  (This
               can also be done by executing the saved file,
               i.e., typing its name in as a command)

       Arguments  may  be  optionally preceded by a `-'.  Several
       arguments may be concatenated together, but not after  `s'
       or  `t'  arguments, since they can be followed by an arbi-
       trary string.  Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An
       argument  of  a  lone  `-'  gets a description of possible
       arguments.

       If _t_e_r_m has capabilities for direct cursor  movement  (see
       _t_e_r_m_c_a_p(5))  _b_a_c_k_g_a_m_m_o_n  ``fixes''  the  board  after each
       move, so the board does not need to be  reprinted,  unless
       the  screen suffers some horrendous malady.  Also, any `p'
       option will be ignored.  (The `t' option is not  necessary
       unless  the  terminal type does not match the entry in the
       /etc/termcap data base.)

QQUUIICCKK RREEFFEERREENNCCEE
       When the program prompts by typing only your color, type a
       space or carriage return to roll, or


       dd       to double

       pp       to print the board

       qq       to quit

       ss       to save the game for later

       When the program prompts with 'Move:', type


       pp       to print the board

       qq       to quit

       ss       to save the game

       or a _m_o_v_e, which is a sequence of


       ss--ff     move from ss to ff

       ss//rr     move one man on ss the roll rr

       separated  by  commas or spaces and ending with a newline.
       Available abbreviations are


       ss--ff11--ff22   means ss--ff11,,ff11--ff22

       ss//rr11rr22    means ss//rr11,,ss//rr22

       Use `b' for bar and `h' for home, or 0 or 25 as  appropri-
       ate.
