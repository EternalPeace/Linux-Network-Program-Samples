     BBaannnneerr prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.  If
     the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of its standard
     input.  If --ww is given, the output is changed from a width of 132 to _n,
     suitable for a narrow terminal.

     The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width, with no
     breaks between the pages.

BBUUGGSS
     Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \, ^, _, {,
     }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny looking (but in
     a useful way.)

     The --ww option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.  The
     smaller it gets, the grainier the output.  Sometimes it runs letters to-
     gether.
