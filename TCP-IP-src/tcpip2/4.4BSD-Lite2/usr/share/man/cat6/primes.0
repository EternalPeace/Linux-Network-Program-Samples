       The   _f_a_c_t_o_r   utility   will   factor   integers  between
       -2147483648 and 2147483647 inclusive.  When  a  number  is
       factored, it is printed, followed by a ``:'', and the list
       of factors on  a  single  line.   Factors  are  listed  in
       ascending order, and are preceded by a space.  If a factor
       divides a value more than once, it will  be  printed  more
       than once.

       When  _f_a_c_t_o_r  is  invoked with one or more arguments, each
       argument will be factored.

       When _f_a_c_t_o_r is invoked with  no  arguments,  _f_a_c_t_o_r  reads
       numbers,  one  per line, from standard input, until end of
       file or error.  Leading white-space and  empty  lines  are
       ignored.   Numbers  may  be  preceded  by a single - or +.
       Numbers are terminated by a non-digit character (such as a
       newline).   After a number is read, it is factored.  Input
       lines must not be longer than 255 characters.

       The _p_r_i_m_e_s utility prints primes in ascending  order,  one
       per line, starting at or above ssttaarrtt and continuing until,
       but not including ssttoopp..  The ssttaarrtt value must be at  least
       0  and  not  greater than ssttoopp.. The ssttoopp value must not be
       greater than 4294967295.  The default  value  of  ssttoopp  is
       4294967295.

       When  the  _p_r_i_m_e_s  utility  is  invoked with no arguments,
       ssttaarrtt is read from standard input.  SSttoopp is  taken  to  be
       4294967295.   The  ssttaarrtt value may be preceded by a single
       +.  The ssttaarrtt value is terminated by a non-digit character
       (such  as  a  newline).  The input line must not be longer
       than 255 characters.

       Out of range or invalid  input  results  in  `ouch'  being
       written to standard error.

       _F_a_c_t_o_r  cannot  handle the ``10 most wanted'' factor list,
       _p_r_i_m_e_s won't get you a world record.
