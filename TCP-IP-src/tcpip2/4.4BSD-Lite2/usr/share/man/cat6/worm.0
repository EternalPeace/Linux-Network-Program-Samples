       In  _w_o_r_m_, you are a little worm, your body is the "o"'s on
       the screen and your head is the "@".  You  move  with  the
       hjkl  keys (as in the game snake).  If you don't press any
       keys, you continue in the direction you last  moved.   The
       upper  case  HJKL keys move you as if you had pressed sev-
       eral (9 for HL and 5 for JK) of  the  corresponding  lower
       case key (unless you run into a digit, then it stops).

       On  the screen you will see a digit, if your worm eats the
       digit is  will  grow  longer,  the  actual  amount  longer
       depends on which digit it was that you ate.  The object of
       the game is to see how long you can make the worm grow.

       The game ends when the worm runs into either the sides  of
       the  screen,  or  itself.  The current score (how much the
       worm has grown) is kept in the upper left  corner  of  the
       screen.

       The  optional  argument, if present, is the initial length
       of the worm.

BBUUGGSS
       If the initial length of the worm is set to less than  one
       or more than 75, various strange things happen.
