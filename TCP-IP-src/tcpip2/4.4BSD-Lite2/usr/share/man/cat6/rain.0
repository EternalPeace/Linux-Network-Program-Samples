       _R_a_i_n's display is modeled after the VAX/VMS program of the
       same name.  The terminal has to be set for  9600  baud  to
       obtain the proper effect.

       As  with  all programs that use _t_e_r_m_c_a_p, the TERM environ-
       ment variable must be set (and exported) to  the  type  of
       the terminal being used.
