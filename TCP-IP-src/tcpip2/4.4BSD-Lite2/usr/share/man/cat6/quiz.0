     The qquuiizz utility tests your knowledge of random facts.  It has a database
     of subjects from which you can choose.  With no arguments, qquuiizz displays
     the list of available subjects.

     The options are as follows:

     --tt      Use tutorial mode, in which questions are repeated later if you
             didn't get them right the first time, and new questions are pre-
             sented less frequently to help you learn the older ones.

     --ii      Specify an alternate index file.

     Subjects are divided into categories.  You can pick any two categories
     from the same subject.  QQuuiizz will ask questions from the first category
     and it expects answers from the second category.  For example, the com-
     mand ``quiz victim killer'' asks questions which are the names of vic-
     tims, and expects you to answer with the cause of their untimely demise,
     whereas the command ``quiz killer victim'' works the other way around.

     If you get the answer wrong, qquuiizz lets you try again.  To see the right
     answer, enter a blank line.

     The index and data files have a similar syntax.  Lines in them consist of
     several categories separated by colons.  The categories are regular ex-
     pressions formed using the following meta-characters:

           pat|pat  alternate patterns
           {pat}    optional pattern
           [pat]    delimiters, as in pat[pat|pat]pat

     In an index file, each line represents a subject.  The first category in
     each subject is the pathname of the data file for the subject.  The re-
     maining categories are regular expressions for the titles of each catego-
     ry in the subject.

     In data files, each line represents a question/answer set.  Each category
     is the information for the question/answer for that category.

     The backslash character (``\'') is used to quote syntactically signifi-
     cant characters, or at the end of a line to signify that a continuation
     line follows.

     If either a question or its answer is empty, qquuiizz will refrain from ask-
     ing it.

     QQuuiizz is pretty cynical about certain subjects.
