       _F_i_s_h  is  the  game _G_o _F_i_s_h, a traditional children's card
       game.

       The computer deals the player and itself seven cards,  and
       places the rest of the deck face-down (figuratively).  The
       object of the game is to collect ``books'', or all of  the
       members  of  a  single rank.  For example, collecting four
       2's would give the player a ``book of 2's''.

       The options are as follows:

       -p     Professional mode.

       The computer makes a random decision as  to  who  gets  to
       start  the  game,  and  then  the computer and player take
       turns asking each other for cards of a specified rank.  If
       the asked player has any cards of the requested rank, they
       give them up to the asking player.  A player must have  at
       least  one  of the cards of the rank they request in their
       hand.  When a player asks for a rank of  which  the  other
       player  has  no  cards, the asker is told to ``Go Fish!''.
       Then, the asker draws a card from the non-dealt cards.  If
       they  draw  the  card  they asked for, they continue their
       turn, asking for more ranks from the other player.  Other-
       wise, the other player gets a turn.

       When  a  player  completes a book, either by getting cards
       from the other player or drawing from the deck,  they  set
       those cards aside and the rank is no longer in play.

       The  game  ends when either player no longer has any cards
       in their hand.  The player with the most books wins.

       The computer cheats only rarely.
