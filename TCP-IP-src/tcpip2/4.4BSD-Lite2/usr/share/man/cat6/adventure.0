     The object of the game is to locate and explore Colossal Cave, find the
     treasures hidden there, and bring them back to the building with you.
     The program is self-descriptive to a point, but part of the game is to
     discover its rules.

     To terminate a game, enter ``quit''; to save a game for later resumption,
     enter ``suspend''.
