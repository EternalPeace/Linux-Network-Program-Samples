       The game _w_u_m_p is based on a fantasy game  first  presented
       in  the  pages  of  _P_e_o_p_l_e_'_s _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r _C_o_m_p_a_n_y in 1973.  In
       Hunt the Wumpus you are placed in a  cave  built  of  many
       different  rooms,  all  interconnected  by  tunnels.  Your
       quest is to find and shoot the evil  Wumpus  that  resides
       elsewhere  in  the  cave  without running into any pits or
       using up your limited supply of arrows.

       The options are as follows:

       _-_a     Specifies the number of magic arrows the adventurer
              gets.  The default is five.

       _-_b     Specifies  the  number  of  rooms in the cave which
              contain bats.  The default is three.

       _-_h     Play the hard version -- more pits, more bats,  and
              a generally more dangerous cave.

       _-_n     Specifies  the  number  of  rooms in the cave which
              contain bottomless pits.  The default is three.

       _-_r     Specifies the number of rooms  in  the  cave.   The
              default cave size is twenty-five rooms.

       _-_t     Specifies  the  number  of  tunnels connecting each
              room in the cave to another room.  Beware, too many
              tunnels in a small cave can easily cause it to col-
              lapse!  The default cave room has three tunnels  to
              other rooms.

       While wandering through the cave you'll notice that, while
       there are tunnels everywhere, there  are  some  mysterious
       quirks  to  the cave topology, including some tunnels that
       go from one room to another,  but  not  necessarily  back!
       Also,  most  pesky  of  all are the rooms that are home to
       large numbers of bats, which, upon being  disturbed,  will
       en  masse  grab you and move you to another portion of the
       cave (including those housing bottomless pits, sure  death
       for unwary explorers).

       Fortunately,  you're  not  going into the cave without any
       weapons or tools, and in fact your biggest aids  are  your

       senses; you can often smell the rather odiferous Wumpus up
       to _t_w_o rooms away, and you can always feel the drafts cre-
       ated  by the occasional bottomless pit and hear the rustle
       of the bats in caves they might be sleeping within.

       To kill the wumpus, you'll need to shoot it  with  one  of
       your  magic  arrows.  Fortunately, you don't have to be in
       the same room as the creature, and can instead  shoot  the
       arrow from as far as three or four rooms away!

       When  you shoot an arrow, you do so by typing in a list of
       rooms that you'd like it to travel to.  If at any point in
       its  travels it cannot find a tunnel to the room you spec-
       ify from the room it's in, it will  instead  randomly  fly
       down one of the tunnels, possibly, if you're real unlucky,
       even flying back into the room you're in and hitting  you!
