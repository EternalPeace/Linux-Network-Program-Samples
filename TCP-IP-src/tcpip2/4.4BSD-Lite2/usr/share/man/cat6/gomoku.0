     GGoommookkuu is a two player game were the object is to get 5 in a row horizon-
     tally, vertically or diagonally on a 19 by 19 grid. By convention, black
     always moves first.  With no arguments, ggoommookkuu will display a playing
     board and prompt for moves from the user.  Valid moves are a letter for
     the column and a number for the row of an empty board location. Entering
     ``quit" or ``resign" will end the game.  You can save the current state
     of the game by entering ``save" and supplying a file name when prompted.
     The optional file _i_n_p_u_t_f_i_l_e can be used to restore a saved game.

     The options are:

     --bb      This option sets background mode. Input moves are read from stan-
             dard input, the computer picks a move, and prints it to standard
             output. The first input line should be either ``black" or
             ``white" to specify whether ggoommookkuu has the first move or not re-
             spectively. This option was intended for game tournaments where a
             referee program handles the board display and pits one program
             against another.

     --cc      Computer verses computer.  GGoommookkuu will play a game against it-
             self. This is mostly used for testing.

     --dd      Print debugging information. Repeating this option more than once
             yields more detailed information.

     --DD _d_e_b_u_g_f_i_l_e
             Print the debug information to _d_e_b_u_g_f_i_l_e instead of to the stan-
             dard output.

     --uu      User verses user. This is mostly used for testing.
