       The object of _b_o_g_g_l_e is to find as many words as  possible
       on the Boggle board within the three minute time limit.  A
       Boggle board is a  four  by  four  arrangement  of  Boggle
       cubes,  each  side of each cube displaying a letter of the
       alphabet or `qu'.  Words are formed by finding a  sequence
       of cubes (letters) that are in the game's dictionary.  The
       (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally, vertically,
       or  diagonally  adjacent to the Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be
       reused.  Words consist solely of lower  case  letters  and
       must be at least 3 letters long.

       Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the
       game.  The ++ flag allows a cube to be used multiple times,
       but  not in succession.  The ++++ flag allows the same cubes
       to be considered adjacent to itself.  AA  sseeeedd  ootthheerr  tthhaann

       The time limit can be changed from the default  3  minutes
       by  using  the  flag --tt##,, where ## is the duration (in sec-
       onds) of each  game.   The  minimum  word  length  can  be
       changed  from  3 letters by specifying --ww##,, where ## is the
       minimum number of letters to use.

       A starting board position can be specified on the  command
       line by listing the board left to right and top to bottom.

       The --bb flag puts _b_o_g_g_l_e in batch mode.  A  bbooaarrddssppeecc  must
       also  be  given.   The dictionary is read from stdin and a
       list of words appearing in bbooaarrddssppeecc is printed to stdout.

       Help  is  available  during  play  by  typing  `?'.   More
       detailed information on the game is given there.

       If there are a great many words in the cube the final dis-
       play  of the words may scroll off of the screen.  (On a 25
       line screen about 130 words can be displayed.)


       No word can contain a 'q' that is not immediately followed
       by a 'u'.


       When  using  the  '+' or '++' options the display of words
