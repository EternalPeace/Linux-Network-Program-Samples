       _B_a_t_t_l_e_s_t_a_r  is  an  adventure  game  in the classic style.
       However, It's slightly less of a puzzle and more a game of
       exploration.   There  are a few magical words in the game,
       but on the whole, simple English should  suffice  to  make
       one's desires understandable to the parser.

TTHHEE SSEETTTTIINNGG
       In  the  days  before  the darkness came, when battlestars
       ruled the heavens...

                 Three He made and gave them to His daughters,
                 Beautiful nymphs, the goddesses of the waters.
                 One to bring good luck and simple feats of wonder,
                 Two to wash the lands and churn the waves asunder,
                 Three to rule the world and purge the skies with thunder.


       In those times great wizards were known and  their  powers
       were  beyond belief.  They could take any object from thin
       air, and, uttering the word `su' could disappear.

       In those times men were known for their lust of  gold  and
       desire  to  wear  fine  weapons.  Swords and coats of mail
       were fashioned that could withstand a laser blast.

       But when the darkness fell, the rightful reigns were  top-
       pled.   Swords  and  helms and heads of state went rolling
       across the grass.  The entire  fleet  of  battlestars  was
       reduced to a single ship.

       Notice  that the "shadow" of the next word stays around if
       you want to take advantage of it.  That is,  saying  "take
       knife"  and then "drop" will drop the knife you just took.

       The two commands "score" and "inven" will print  out  your
       current status in the game.

       The  command  "save"  will save your game in a file called
       "Bstar."  You can recover a saved game by using  the  "-r"
       option when you start up the game.

       The  compass  directions N, S, E, and W can be used if you
       have a compass.  If you don't have a compass, you'll  have
       to  say R, L, A, or B, which stand for Right, Left, Ahead,
       and Back.  Directions printed  in  room  descriptions  are
       always printed in R, L, A, & B relative directions.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       I wrote Battlestar in 1979 in order to experiment with the
       niceties of the C Language.  Most interesting things  that
       happen  in  the game are hardwired into the code, so don't
       send me any hate mail about it!  Instead,  enjoy  art  for
       art's sake!
