       _P_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a  is  a role playing game which allows players to
       roll up characters of various types to fight monsters  and
       other  players.   Progression  of characters is based upon
       gaining experience from fighting monsters (and other play-
       ers).

       Most of the game is menu driven and self-explanatory (more
       or less).  The screen is cursor updated, so be sure to set
       up the TTEERRMM variable in your environment.

       The  options provide for a variety of functions to support
       the game.  They are:


       --ss   Invokes _p_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a without header information.

       --mm   Get a monster listing.

       --aa   Get a listing of all character names on file.

       --xx   Examine/change a particular character on file.

       --HH   Print header only.

       --pp   Purge old characters.

       --bb   Show scoreboard of top characters per login.

       --SS   Turn on wizard options, if  allowed,  if  running  as
            ``root''.

       The  characters  are  saved  on a common file, in order to
       make the game interactive between players.  The characters
       are  given  a  password  in  order to retrieve them later.
       Only characters above lleevveell zero  are  saved.   Characters
       unused  for  awhile  will  be purged.  Characters are only
       placed on the scoreboard when they die.

       A number of the player's  more  important  statistics  are
       almost  always  displayed  on  the  screen,  with maximums
       (where applicable) in parentheses.

       The character is placed randomly  near  the  center  of  a
       cartesian  system.  Most commands are selected with a sin-
       gle letter or digit.  For example, one may move by hitting
       'W', 'S', 'N', or 'E', (lower case may also be used, at no
       time is the game case dependent).  One may also  use  'H',
       'J', 'K', 'L', for movement, similar to _v_i(1).  To move to
       a  specific  (x,  y)  coordinate,  use  the   mmoovvee   ('1')
       command. The  distance  a character can move is calculated
       by 1 plus 1.5 per lleevveell..  Moving in  a  compass  direction
       will  move the player the maximum allowed distance in that
       direction.

       A player may see who else is playing by using the  ppllaayyeerrss
       ('2')  option.   One  may see the coordinates of those who
       are the same distance or closer to the origin  as  he/she.
       KKiinnggss,,  and ccoouunncciill ooff tthhee wwiissee can see and can be seen by
       everyone.  A ppaallaannttiirr removes these restrictions.

       One can talk to other players with the ttaallkk ('3')  option.
       In  general,  this  is  a line or so of text.  To remove a
       current message, just type <return> when  prompted  for  a
       message.

       The ssttaattss ('4') option shows additional characteristics of
       a player.

       One may leave the game either with the qquuiitt ('5')  option.

       One  may rest by default.  Resting lets one regain maximum
       eenneerrggyy lleevveell,, and also lets one find mmaannaa (more  is  found
       for  larger levels and further distances from the origin).

       One may call a monster by hitting '9' or 'C'.

       Use 'X' to examine other players.

       One may quit or execute a sub-shell by hitting  interrupt.
       Quitting  during  battle results in death for obvious rea-
       sons.

       Several other options become available as the player  pro-
       gresses  in  lleevveell  and mmaaggiicc,, or to other stations in the
       game ( vvaallaarr,, ccoouunncciill ooff tthhee  wwiissee,,  kkiinngg  ).   These  are
       described  elsewhere.   In general, a control-L will force
       the redrawing of the screen.

       A  player  has  several  options  while fighting monsters.
       They are as follows:

       mmeelleeee          Inflicts damage on the monster, based  upon
                      ssttrreennggtthh..   Also  decreases  the  monster's
                      ssttrreennggtthh some.

       sskkiirrmmiisshh       Inflicts a little less damage  than  mmeelleeee,,
                      but   decreases   the  monster's  qquuiicckknneessss
                      instead.

       eevvaaddee          Attempt to run away.  Success is based upon
                      both  the player's and the monster's bbrraaiinnss
                      and qquuiicckknneessss..

       ssppeellll          Several   options   for   throwing   spells
                      (described elsewhere).

       nniicckk           Hits  the  monster  one  plus  the player's
                      sswwoorrdd,, and gives the player 10% of the mon-
                      ster's eexxppeerriieennccee..  Decreases the monster's
                      eexxppeerriieennccee an amount  proportional  to  the
                      amount  granted.   This  also increases the
                      monster's  quickness.   Paralyzed  monsters
                      wake up very fast when nicked.

       lluucckkoouutt        This  is  essentially a battle of wits with
                      the monster.     Success is based upon  the
                      player's  and  the  monster's  bbrraaiinnss..  The
                      player gets credit for slaying the  monster
                      if  he/she  succeeds.   Otherwise,  nothing
                      happens, and the chance to lluucckkoouutt is lost.

       Character statistics are rolled randomly  from  the  above

                      within the playing grid.

       The possible ranges for starting statistics are summarized
       in the following table.

       Not only are the starting  characteristics  different  for
       the   different   character   types,  the  characteristics
       progress at different rates for the different types as the
       character goes up in lleevveell.. EExxppeerriimmeennttooeess'' characteristics
       progress randomly as one of the other types.  The progres-
       sion  as characters increase in lleevveell is summarized in the
       following table.

       Halfling      2.0       30      30      4.5     1

       The character type also determines how much gold a  player
       may  carry,  how long until rriinnggss can overcome the player,
       and how much ppooiissoonn the player can withstand.

       Flocking   monsters,  and  bigger  monsters  increase  the
       chances of treasure.

       Certain monsters have special abilities; they are as  fol-

                      monsters in order to confuse.

       DDaarrkk LLoorrdd      very nasty person.  Does not like to be hit
                      (especially nicked), and many spells do not
                      work well (or at all) against him.  One can
                      always eevvaaddee from the DDaarrkk LLoorrdd..

       LLeeaannaann--SSiiddhhee   also  a very nasty person.  She will perma-

       TTiiaammaatt         may  take half a player's ggoolldd and ggeemmss and
                      escape.

       KKoobboolldd         may get nasty and steal one gold piece  and
                      run away.

       SShheelloobb         may  bite, inflicting the equivalent of one

       A monster may also be carrying ggoolldd or  ggeemmss..   These  are
       used  at  ttrraaddiinngg  ppoossttss to buy things.A ggeemm is worth 1000
       gold pieces.  Too much ggoolldd will slow a player down.   One
       may  carry  1000 plus 200 per lleevveell of ggoolldd..  A ggeemm weighs
       one half a gold piece.  Monsters of  treasure  type  7  or
       higher may carry ggeemmss..

       The  chance  of  a  cursed treasure is based upon treasure
       type.  The more valuable treasures have a  greater  chance
       of  being  cursed.   A cursed treasure knocks eenneerrggyy lleevveell
       very low, and adds 0.25 ppooiissoonn..

       RRiinnggss

       RRiinnggss are only carried by nnaazzgguullss  and  DDaarrkk  LLoorrdd..   They
       come in four different flavors.  All rriinnggss rest the player
       to maximum and cause him/her to hit much harder in  battle
       with monsters (assuming one has chosen to use the rriinngg for
       battle.)

       Two types of rriinnggss are cursed and come either from nnaazzgguullss
       or DDaarrkk LLoorrdd..  After a few times of using these types, the
       player falls under the control of the rriinngg,,  and  strange,
       random  things  will  occur.  Eventually, the player dies,
       and gives his/her name to a monster on  the  file.   Dying
       before the rriinngg is used up also renames the monster.

       The  two  remaining  types  of rriinnggss are much more benign.
       The one from a nnaazzgguull is good  for  a  limited  number  of

       was being used when he/she died.  The one from  DDaarrkk  LLoorrdd
       is  the same, except that it never is used up.  rriinnggss dis-
       appear after  saving  someone  from  death.   In  general,
       cursed  rriinnggss  occur much more often than normal ones.  It
       is usually not a good idea to pick one up.  The  only  way
       to get rid of a rriinngg is to have a monster steal it.

       KKiinngg

       A  player  may become kkiinngg bbyy ffiinnddiinngg aa _c_r_o_w_n and going to
       (0,0).  Players must have a lleevveell in the range  of  10  to
       1000  to  be able to find a _c_r_o_w_n_.  When a player with one
       or more _c_r_o_w_n_s reaches lleevveell 1000,  the  _c_r_o_w_n_s  are  con-
       verted to _g_o_l_d_.

       Once  a player is king, he/she may do certain things while
       in the Lord's Chamber (0,0).  These are exercised with the
       ddeeccrreeee ('0') option.

       _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t      This  is  done  to another player.  It ran-
                      domly moves the affected player  about.   A
                      cchhaarrmm protects from transports.

       _c_u_r_s_e          This  is  done  to  another  player.  It is
                      analogous to cursed  treasure,  but  worse.
                      It inflicts two ppooiissoonn,, knocks eenneerrggyy lleevveell
                      very low, and degrades the maximum  energy.
                      It  also  removes a ccllooaakk..  A bblleessssiinngg pro-
                      tects from king's curses.

       _e_n_e_r_g_y _v_o_i_d    The king may put a number  of  these  scat-
                      tered   about  his/her  kingdom  as  he/she
                      pleases.  If  a  player  hits  one,  he/she
                      loses  mmaannaa,,  eenneerrggyy,, and ggoolldd..  The energy
                      void disappears after being hit.

       _b_e_s_t_o_w         This is also done to another  player.   The
                      king  may  wish to reward one or more loyal
                      subjects by sharing his/her riches  (  ggoolldd
                      ).  Or it is a convenient way to dispose of
                      some unwanted deadweight.

       _c_o_l_l_e_c_t _t_a_x_e_s  Everyone pays 7% tax on all ggoolldd  and  ggeemmss

                      kkiinngg..  The king collects the accrued  taxes
                      with this option.

       The  kkiinngg may also tteelleeppoorrtt anywhere for free by using the
       origin as a starting place.

       A player automatically becomes a member of the ccoouunncciill  ooff
       tthhee wwiissee upon reaching level 3000.  Members of the council
       cannot have rriinnggss..  Members of  the  council  have  a  few
       extra  options  which  they can exercise.  These are exer-
       cised iinntteerrvveennee ('8') option.  All iinntteerrvveennee options  cost
       1000  mana.   One  iinntteerrvveennee  option  is  to  _h_e_a_l another
       player.  This is just a quick way for that  player  to  be
       rested to maximum and lose a little ppooiissoonn..  The main pur-
       pose in life for members of the council  is  to  seek  the
       HHoollyy  GGrraaiill..   This is done with a ppaallaannttiirr under the _s_e_e_k
       _g_r_a_i_l option.  The distance cited by the seek is  accurate
       within  10%,  in order not to make it too easy to find the
       grail.  A player must have infinitesimally small  ssiinn,,  or
       else  it's  all  over upon finding the grail.  In order to
       help members of the council on their quest, they may _t_e_l_e_-
       _p_o_r_t with greater ease.


       Upon finding the grail, the player advances to position of
       vvaallaarr..  He/she may then exercise more and niftier  options
       under _i_n_t_e_r_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_.  These include all of the council mem-
       bers' options plus  the  ability  to  move  other  players
       about,  bless them, and throw monsters at them.  A vvaallaarr's
       blessing has the same effect  as  the  treasure  _b_l_e_s_s_i_n_g_,
       except  that  the  affected  player  does  not get his/her
       _b_l_e_s_s_i_n_g flag set.  All _i_n_t_e_r_v_e_n_t_i_o_n options which  affect
       other  players  age  the player who uses them.  VVaallaarrss are
       essentially immortal, but are actually given  five  lives.
       If  these  are  used  up,  the  player is left to die, and
       becomes an eexx--vvaallaarr..  A vvaallaarr cannot  _m_o_v_e_,  _t_e_l_e_p_o_r_t_,  or
       call  monsters.   (An  exception  to  this is if the _v_a_l_a_r
       finds a _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_e_r_.  This is to allow him/her to  dispose
       of excess _g_o_l_d_.  Any monsters which a vvaallaarr encounters are
       based upon his/her size.  Only one valar may  exist  at  a
       time.   The  current valar is replaced when another player
       finds the grail.  The valar is then  bumped  back  to  the
       council of the wise.

       WWiizzaarrdd

       The  _w_i_z_a_r_d  is usually the owner of the game, and the one
       who maintains the associated files.  The _w_i_z_a_r_d is granted
       special  powers within the game, if it is invoked with the
       '-S' option.  Otherwise, the  _w_i_z_a_r_d  plays  no  different
       from  other  players.   The  _w_i_z_a_r_d abilities are outlined
       below.

              One  extra  option,  _v_a_p_o_r_i_z_e_, is added to kill any

              An extra character type is added.   This  character
              starts with the maximum possible in all statistics,
              selected from the other character types.   A  ssuuppeerr
              character's statistics also progress at the maximum

       Certain  regions of the playing grid have different names.
       In general, this is only to give the player some  idea  of
       his/her present location.  Some special places do exist.

       _T_r_a_d_i_n_g _P_o_s_t_s  These  are located at |x| == |y| == n*n*100

                      out  have more things for sale.  Be careful
                      about cheating the merchants there, as they
                      have  short tempers.  Merchants are dishon-

       A _m_e_d_i_c wants half of a player's ggoolldd to be happy.  Offer-
