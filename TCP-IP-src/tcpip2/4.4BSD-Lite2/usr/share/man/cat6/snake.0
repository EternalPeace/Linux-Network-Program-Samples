       Snake  is  a  display-based game which must be played on a
       CRT terminal.  The object of the game is to make  as  much
       money as possible without getting eaten by the snake.  The
       --ll and --ww options allow you  to  specify  the  length  and
       width  of the field.  By default the entire screen (except
       for the last column) is used.

       You are represented on the screen by an I.  The snake is 6
       squares  long  and is represented by S's.  The money is $,
       and an exit is #.  Your score is posted in the upper  left
       hand corner.

       You  can  move around using the same conventions as vi(1),
       the h, j, k, and l keys work, as do the arrow keys.  Other
       possibilities include:

       sefc   These  keys  are  like hjkl but form a directed pad
              around the d key.

       HJKL   These keys move you all the way  in  the  indicated
              direction  to  the same row or column as the money.
              This does _n_o_t let you jump away from the snake, but
              rather  saves you from having to type a key repeat-
              edly.  The snake still gets all his turns.

       SEFC   Likewise for the upper case versions on the left.

       ATPB   These keys move  you  to  the  four  edges  of  the
              screen.   Their  position  on  the  keyboard is the
              mnemonic, e.g.  P is at the far right of  the  key-
              board.

       x      This lets you quit the game at any time.

       p      Points in a direction you might want to go.

       w      Space  warp  to  get  out  of  tight squeezes, at a
              price.

       To earn money, move to the same square the money is on.  A
       new  $  will appear when you earn the current one.  As you
       get richer, the snake gets hungrier.  To leave  the  game,
       move to the exit (#).

       A  record  is  kept  of  the  personal  best score of each
       player.  Scores are only counted if you leave at the exit,
       getting eaten by the snake is worth nothing.

       As  in  pinball,  matching the last digit of your score to
       the number which appears after the game is worth a  bonus.

       To see who wastes time playing snake, run _s_n_s_c_o_r_e _.

       When playing on a small screen, it's hard to tell when you
       hit the edge of the screen.

       The scoring function takes into account the  size  of  the
       screen.   A  perfect function to do this equitably has not
       been devised.
