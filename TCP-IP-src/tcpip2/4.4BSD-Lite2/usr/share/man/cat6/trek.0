       _T_r_e_k is a game of space glory and war.  Below is a summary
       of commands.  For complete documentation, see _T_r_e_k by Eric
       Allman.

       If  a filename is given, a log of the game is written onto
       that file.  If the --aa flag is given before  the  filename,
       that file is appended to, not truncated.

       The  game  will  ask  you what length game you would like.
       Valid responses are "short", "medium",  and  "long".   You
       may also type "restart", which restarts a previously saved
       game.  You will then be prompted for the skill,  to  which
       you must respond "novice", "fair", "good", "expert", "com-
       modore", or "impossible".  You should normally  start  out
       with a novice and work up.

       In  general,  throughout  the  game, if you forget what is
       appropriate the game will tell you what it expects if  you
       just type in a question mark.
