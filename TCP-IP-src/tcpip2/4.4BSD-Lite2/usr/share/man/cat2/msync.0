     The mmssyynncc() system call writes any modified pages back to the filesystem
     and updates the file modification time.  If _l_e_n is 0, all modified pages
     within the region containing _a_d_d_r will be flushed; if _l_e_n is non-zero,
     only the pages containing _a_d_d_r and _l_e_n succeeding locations will be exam-
     ined.  Any required synchronization of memory caches will also take place
     at this time.  Filesystem operations on a file that is mapped for shared
     modifications are unpredictable except after an mmssyynncc().

EERRRROORRSS
     The following errors may be reported:

     [EINVAL]      The _a_d_d_r parameter was not page aligned.

     [EINVAL]      The _a_d_d_r parameter did not specify an address part of a
                   mapped region.

     [EINVAL]      The _l_e_n parameter was negative.

     [EIO]         An I/O error occured while writing to the file system.

     The mmssyynncc() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
