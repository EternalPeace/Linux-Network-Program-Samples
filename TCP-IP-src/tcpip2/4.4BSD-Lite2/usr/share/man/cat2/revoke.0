     The rreevvookkee function invalidates all current open file descriptors in the
     system for the file named by _p_a_t_h. Subsequent operations on any such de-
     scriptors fail, with the exceptions that a rreeaadd() from a character device
     file which has been revoked returns a count of zero (end of file), and a
     cclloossee() call will succeed.  If the file is a special file for a device
     which is open, the device close function is called as if all open refer-
     ences to the file had been closed.

     Access to a file may be revoked only by its owner or the super user.  The
     rreevvookkee function is currently supported only for block and character spe-
     cial device files.  It is normally used to prepare a terminal device for
     a new login session, preventing any access by a previous user of the ter-
     minal.

     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return value indicates
     an error occurred and _e_r_r_n_o is set to indicated the reason.

EERRRROORRSS
     Access to the named file is revoked unless one of the following:

     [ENOTDIR]     A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]
                   A component of a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an
                   entire path name exceeded 1024 characters.

     [ENOENT]      The named file or a component of the path name does not ex-
                   ist.

     [EACCES]      Search permission is denied for a component of the path
                   prefix.

     [ELOOP]       Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the
                   pathname.

     [EFAULT]      _P_a_t_h points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EINVAL]      The named file is neither a character special or block spe-
                   cial file.

     [EPERM]       The caller is neither the owner of the file nor the super
                   user.
