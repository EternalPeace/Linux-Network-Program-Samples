     rrwwhhoo - who is logged in on local machines

     The rrwwhhoo command produces output similar to who,  but for all machines on
     the local network.  If no report has been received from a machine for 5
     minutes then rrwwhhoo assumes the machine is down, and does not report users
     last known to be logged into that machine.

     If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then rrwwhhoo re-
     ports this idle time.  If a user hasn't typed to the system for an hour
     or more, then the user will be omitted from the output of rrwwhhoo unless the
     --aa flag is given.

     The rrwwhhoo command appeared in 4.3BSD.

     This is unwieldy when the number of machines on the local net is large.
