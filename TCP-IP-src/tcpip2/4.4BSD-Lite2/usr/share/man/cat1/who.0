     The utility wwhhoo displays a list of all users currently logged on, showing
     for each user the login name, tty name, the date and time of login, and
     hostname if not local.

     Available options:

     _a_m _I  Returns the invoker's real user name.

     _f_i_l_e  By default, wwhhoo gathers information from the file _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_u_t_m_p. An
           alternate _f_i_l_e may be specified which is usually _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_w_t_m_p (or
           _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_w_t_m_p_._[_0_-_6_] depending on site policy as _w_t_m_p can grow quite
           large and daily versions may or may not be kept around after com-
           pression by ac(8)).  The _w_t_m_p file contains a record of every lo-
           gin, logout, crash, shutdown and date change since _w_t_m_p was last
           truncated or created.

     If _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_w_t_m_p is being used as the file, the user name may be empty or
     one of the special characters '|', '}' and '~'.  Logouts produce an out-
     put line without any user name.  For more information on the special
     characters, see utmp(5).
