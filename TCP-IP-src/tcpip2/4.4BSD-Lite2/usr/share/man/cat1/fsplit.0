     FFsspplliitt takes as input either a file or standard input containing Fortran
     source code.  It attempts to split the input into separate routine files
     of the form _n_a_m_e_._f, where _n_a_m_e is the name of the program unit (e.g.
     function, subroutine, block data or program).  The name for unnamed block
     data subprograms has the form _b_l_k_d_t_a_N_N_N_._f where NNN is three digits and a
     file of this name does not already exist.  For unnamed main programs the
     name has the form _m_a_i_n_N_N_N_._f. If there is an error in classifying a pro-
     gram unit, or if _n_a_m_e_._f already exists, the program unit will be put in a
     file of the form _z_z_z_N_N_N_._f where _z_z_z_N_N_N_._f does not already exist.

     --ee _e_f_i_l_e    Normally each subprogram unit is split into a separate file.
                 When the --ee option is used, only the specified subprogram
                 units are split into separate files.  E.g.:

                       fsplit -e readit -e doit prog.f

                 will split readit and doit into separate files.

     If names specified via the --ee option are not found, a diagnostic is writ-
     ten to standard error.

     FFsspplliitt assumes the subprogram name is on the first noncomment line of the
     subprogram unit.  Nonstandard source formats may confuse ffsspplliitt.

     It is hard to use --ee for unnamed main programs and block data subprograms
     since you must predict the created file name.
