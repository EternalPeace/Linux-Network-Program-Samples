     The chgrp utility sets the group ID of the file named by each _f_i_l_e
     operand to the _g_r_o_u_p ID specified by the group operand.

     Options:

     --HH      If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
             are not followed.)

     --LL      If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     --PP      If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

     --RR      Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted in the files
             instead of just the files themselves.

     --ff      The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors and
             doesn't query about strange modes (unless the user does not have
             proper permissions).

     Symbolic links don't have groups, so unless the --HH or --LL option is set,
     cchhggrrpp on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.  The --HH, --LL
     and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR option is specified.  In addi-
     tion, these options override each other and the command's actions are de-
     termined by the last one specified.

     The _g_r_o_u_p operand can be either a group name from the group database, or
     a numeric group ID.  If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the
     operand is used as a group name.

     The user invoking cchhggrrpp must belong to the specified group and be the
     owner of the file, or be the super-user.

     The cchhggrrpp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     Previous versions of the cchhggrrpp utility changed the group of symbolic
     links specified on the command line.  In this system, symbolic links do
     not have groups.
