     sspplliitt - split a file into pieces

     The sspplliitt utility reads the given _f_i_l_e (or standard input if no file is
     specified) and breaks it up into files of 1000 lines each.

     The options are as follows:

     --bb      Create smaller files _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t bytes in length.  If ``k'' is ap-
             pended to the number, the file is split into _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t kilobyte
             pieces.  If ``m'' is appended to the number, the file is split
             into _b_y_t_e___c_o_u_n_t megabyte pieces.

     --ll      Create smaller files _n lines in length.

     If additional arguments are specified, the first is used as the name of
     the input file which is to be split.  If a second additional argument is
     specified, it is used as a prefix for the names of the files into which
     the file is split.  In this case, each file into which the file is split
     is named by the prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix in the
     range of ``aa-zz''.

     If the _n_a_m_e argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically
     ordered files named in the range of ``xaa-zzz''.

BBUUGGSS
     For historical reasons, if you specify _n_a_m_e, sspplliitt can only create 676
     separate files.  The default naming convention allows 2028 separate
     files.
