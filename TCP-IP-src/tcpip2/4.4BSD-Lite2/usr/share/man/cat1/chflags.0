     The cchhffllaaggss utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-
     fied by the _f_l_a_g_s operand.

     The options are as follows:

     --HH      If the --RR option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
             are not followed.)

     --LL      If the --RR option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     --PP      If the --RR option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

     --RR      Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the
             files instead of just the files themselves.

     Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.  The following keywords are
     currently defined:

           opaque  set the opaque flag (owner or super-user only)
           nodump  set the nodump flag (owner or super-user only)
           sappnd  set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
           schg    set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
           uappnd  set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
           uchg    set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)

     Putting the letters ``no'' before an option causes the flag to be turned
     off.  For example:

           nouchg  the immutable bit should be cleared

     Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the --HH or --LL option is set,
     cchhffllaaggss on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.  The --HH, --LL
     and --PP options are ignored unless the --RR option is specified.  In addi-
     tion, these options override each other and the command's actions are de-
     termined by the last one specified.

     The cchhffllaaggss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
