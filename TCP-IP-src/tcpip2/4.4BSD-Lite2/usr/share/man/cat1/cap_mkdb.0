     CCaapp__mmkkddbb builds a hashed database out of the getcap(3) logical database
     constructed by the concatenation of the specified files .

     The database is named by the basename of the first file argument and the
     string ``.db''. The getcap(3) routines can access the database in this
     form much more quickly than they can the original text file(s).

     The ``tc'' capabilities of the records are expanded before the record is
     stored into the database.

     The options as as follows:

     --ff _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
             Specify a different database basename.

     --vv      Print out the number of capability records in the database.

FFOORRMMAATT
     Each record is stored in the database using two different types of keys.

     The first type is a key which consists of the first capability of the
     record (not including the trailing colon (``:'')) with a data field con-
     sisting of a special byte followed by the rest of the record.  The spe-
     cial byte is either a 0 or 1, where a 0 means that the record is okay,
     and a 1 means that there was a ``tc'' capability in the record that
     couldn't be expanded.

     The second type is a key which consists of one of the names from the
     first capability of the record with a data field consisting a special
     byte followed by the the first capability of the record.  The special
     byte is a 2.

     In normal operation names are looked up in the database, resulting in a
     key/data pair of the second type.  The data field of this key/data pair
     is used to look up a key/data pair of the first type which has the real
     data associated with the name.
