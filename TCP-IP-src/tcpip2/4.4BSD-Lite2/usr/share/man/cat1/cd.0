     _D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is an absolute or relative pathname which becomes the new work-
     ing directory.  The interpretation of a relative pathname by cd depends
     on the CDPATH environment variable (see below).

     The following environment variables affect the execution of cd:

     CDPATH  If the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y operand does not begin with a slash (/) charac-
             ter, and the first component is not dot (.) or dot-dot (..), ccdd
             searches for the directory relative to each directory named in
             the CDPATH variable, in the order listed.  The new working direc-
             tory is set to the first matching directory found.  An empty
             string in place of a directory pathname represents the current
             directory.  If the new working directory was derived from CDPATH,
             it will be printed to the standard output.

     HOME    If ccdd is invoked without arguments and the HOME environment vari-
             able exists and contains a directory name, that directory becomes
             the new working directory.

     See csh(1) for more information on environment variables.

     The ccdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The ccdd command is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
