     The mmaann utility displays the BSD manual pages entitled _n_a_m_e.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Display all of the manual pages for a specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n and _n_a_m_e
             combination.  (Normally, only the first manual page found is dis-
             played.)

     --CC      Use the specified _f_i_l_e instead of the default configuration file.
             This permits users to configure their own manual environment.
             See man.conf(5) for a description of the contents of this file.

     --cc      Copy the manual page to the standard output instead of using
             more(1) to paginate it.  This is done by default if the standard
             output is not a terminal device.

     --hh      Display only the ``SYNOPSIS'' lines of the requested manual
             pages.

     --MM      Override the list of standard directories which mmaann searches for
             manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon (``:'') separat-
             ed list of directories.  This search path may also be set using
             the environment variable MANPATH. The subdirectories to be
             searched, and their search order, is specified by the ``_subdir''
             line in the mmaann configuration file.

     --mm      Augment the list of standard directories which mmaann searches for
             manual pages.  The supplied _p_a_t_h must be a colon (``:'') separat-
             ed list of directories.  These directories will be searched be-
             fore the standard directories or the directories specified using
             the --MM option or the MANPATH environment variable.  The subdirec-
             tories to be searched, and their search order, is specified by
             the ``_subdir'' line in the mmaann configuration file.

     --ww      List the pathnames of the manual pages which mmaann would display
             for the specified _s_e_c_t_i_o_n and _n_a_m_e combination.

     The optional _s_e_c_t_i_o_n argument restricts the directories that mmaann will
     search.  The mmaann configuration file (see man.conf(5))  specifies the pos-
     sible _s_e_c_t_i_o_n values that are currently available.  If only a single ar-
     gument is specified or if the first argument is not a valid section, mmaann
     assumes that the argument is the name of a manual page to be displayed.

     MACHINE   As some manual pages are intended only for specific architec-
               tures, mmaann searches any subdirectories, with the same name as
               the current architecture, in every directory which it searches.
               Machine specific areas are checked before general areas.  The
               current machine type may be overridden by setting the environ-
               ment variable MACHINE to the name of a specific architecture.

     MANPATH   The standard search path used by mmaann may be overridden by spec-
               ifying a path in the MANPATH environment variable.  The format
               of the path is a colon (``:'') separated list of directories.
               The subdirectories to be searched as well as their search order
               is specified by the ``_subdir'' line in the mmaann configuration

               file.

     PAGER     Any value of the environment variable PAGER will be used in-
               stead of the standard pagination program, more(1).

     The on-line manual pages are, by necessity, forgiving toward stupid dis-
     play devices, causing a few manual pages to not as nicely formatted as
     their typeset counterparts.
