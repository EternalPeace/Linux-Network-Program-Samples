       The  _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y  utility destroys the user's active Kerberos
       authorization tickets by writing zeros to  the  file  that
       contains  them.   If  the ticket file does not exist, _k_d_e_-
       _s_t_r_o_y displays a message to that effect.

       After overwriting the file, _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y removes the file from
       the system.  The utility displays a message indicating the
       success or failure  of  the  operation.   If  _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y  is
       unable  to  destroy the ticket file, the utility will warn
       you by making your terminal beep.

       In the Athena workstation environment, the _t_o_e_h_o_l_d service
       automatically  destroys  your tickets when you end a work-
       station session.  If your site does not provide a  similar
       ticket-destroying  mechanism,  you  can place the _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y
       command in your _._l_o_g_o_u_t file  so  that  your  tickets  are
       destroyed automatically when you logout.

       The options to _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y are as follows:

       --ff     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y  runs  without  displaying the status mes-
              sage.

       --qq     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y will not make your  terminal  beep  if  it
              fails to destroy the tickets.

       Only  the  tickets  in  the user's current ticket file are
       destroyed.  Separate ticket files are used  to  hold  root
       instance  and  password  changing  tickets.   These  files
       should probably be destroyed too, or all of a user's tick-
       ets kept in a single ticket file.
