     PPwwdd writes the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the
     standard output.

     The pwd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The ppwwdd command is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible .

     cd(1),  csh(1),  getcwd(3)

BBUUGGSS
     In csh(1) the command ddiirrss is always faster (although it can give a dif-
     ferent answer in the rare case that the current directory or a containing
     directory was moved after the shell descended into it).
