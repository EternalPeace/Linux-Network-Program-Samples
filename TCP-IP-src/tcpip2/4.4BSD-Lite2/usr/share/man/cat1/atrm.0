     AAttrrmm removes jobs that were created with the at(1) command.

     Options available are:

     --ff      all information regarding the removal of the specified jobs is
             suppressed.

     --ii      aattrrmm asks if a job should be removed; a response of `y' causes
             the job to be removed.

     --       all jobs belonging to the person invoking aattrrmm are removed.

     If a _j_o_b number(s) is specified, aattrrmm attempts to remove only that _j_o_b
     number(s).

     If a user(s) name is specified, all jobs belonging to that user(s) are
     removed.  This form of invoking aattrrmm is useful only to the super-user.
