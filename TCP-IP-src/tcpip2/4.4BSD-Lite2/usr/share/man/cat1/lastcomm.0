     LLaassttccoommmm gives information on previously executed commands.  With no ar-
     guments, llaassttccoommmm prints information about all the commands recorded dur-
     ing the current accounting file's lifetime.

     Option:

     --ff _f_i_l_e     Read from _f_i_l_e rather than the default accounting file.

     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     name, _u_s_e_r name, or _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l name are printed.  So, for example:

           lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named _a_._o_u_t by
     user _r_o_o_t on the terminal _t_t_y_d_0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

           ++oo   The name of the user who ran the process.
           ++oo   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the sys-
               tem.
           ++oo   The command name under which the process was called.
           ++oo   The amount of cpu time used by the process (in seconds).
           ++oo   The time the process exited.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was execut-
     ed by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after a fork, but
     without a following exec,  ``C'' indicates the command was run in PDP-11
     compatibility mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command terminated
     with the generation of a _c_o_r_e file, and ``X'' indicates the command was
     terminated with a signal.

FFIILLEESS
     /var/account/acct  Default accounting file.
