     The dduu utility displays the file system block usage for each file argu-
     ment and for each directory in the file hierarchy rooted in each directo-
     ry argument.  If no file is specified, the block usage of the hierarchy
     rooted in the current directory is displayed.  The number of blocks are
     in the same units as that returned by the stat(2) system call, i.e.
     512-byte blocks.  Partial numbers of blocks are rounded up.

     The options are as follows:

     --HH      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  (Symbolic links
             encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)

     --LL      All symbolic links are followed.

     --PP      No symbolic links are followed.

     --aa      Display an entry for each file in the file hierarchy.

     --ss      Display only the grand total for the specified files.

     --xx      Filesystem mount points are not traversed.

     DDuu counts the storage used by symbolic links and not the files they ref-
     erence unless the --HH or --LL option is specified.  If either the --HH or --LL
     options are specified, storage used by any symbolic links which are fol-
     lowed is not counted or displayed.  The --HH, --LL and --PP options override
     each other and the command's actions are determined by the last one spec-
     ified.

     Files having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single
     time per dduu execution.

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environmental variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                counts will be displayed in units of that size block.
