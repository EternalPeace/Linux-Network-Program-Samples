       This file documents the GNU version  of  rreeffeerr,  which  is
       part  of  the  groff  document  formatting  system.  rreeffeerr
       copies the contents of _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e...  to the  standard  out-
       put,  except that lines between ..[[ and ..]]  are interpreted
       as citations, and lines between ..RR11  and  ..RR22  are  inter-
       preted  as  commands  about  how  citations are to be pro-
       cessed.

       Each citation specifies a  reference.   The  citation  can
       specify  a  reference that is contained in a bibliographic
       database by giving a set of keywords that only that refer-
       ence  contains.   Alternatively it can specify a reference
       by supplying a database record in the citation.  A  combi-
       nation of these alternatives is also possible.

       For  each  citation, rreeffeerr can produce a mark in the text.
       This mark consists of some label which  can  be  separated
       from  the text and from other labels in various ways.  For
       each reference it also outputs ggrrooffff commands that can  be
       used  by  a macro package to produce a formatted reference
       for each citation.  The output of rreeffeerr must therefore  be
       processed using a suitable macro package.  The --mmss and --mmee
       macros are both suitable.  The commands to format a  cita-
       tion's reference can be output immediately after the cita-
       tion, or the references may be accumulated, and  the  com-
       mands  output  at some later point.  If the references are
       accumulated, then multiple citations of the same reference
       will produce a single formatted reference.

       The  interpretation  of  lines between ..RR11 and ..RR22 as com-
       mands is a new feature of GNU refer.  Documents making use
       of  this feature can still be processed by Unix refer just
       by adding the lines

              ..ddee RR11
              ..iigg RR22
              ....
       to the beginning of the document.  This will  cause  ttrrooffff
       to  ignore  everything between ..RR11 and ..RR22.  The effect of
       some commands can also  be  achieved  by  options.   These
       options  are  supported mainly for compatibility with Unix

       refer.  It is usually more convenient to use commands.

       rreeffeerr generates ..llff lines so that filenames and line  num-
       bers in messages produced by commands that read rreeffeerr out-
       put will be correct; it also  interprets  lines  beginning
       with  ..llff  so  that filenames and line numbers in the mes-
       sages and ..llff lines that it produces will be accurate even
       if  the  input  has been preprocessed by a command such as

       The  bibliographic  database  is a text file consisting of
       records separated by one or more blank lines.  Within each
       record  fields  start with a %% at the beginning of a line.
       Each field has a one character name that immediately  fol-
       lows  the  %%.  It is best to use only upper and lower case
       letters for the names of fields.  The name  of  the  field
       should  be  followed by exactly one space, and then by the
       contents of the field.  Empty  fields  are  ignored.   The
       conventional meaning of each field is as follows:

       AA      The  name  of  an  author.   If the name contains a
              title such as JJrr..  at the end, it should  be  sepa-
              rated  from the last name by a comma.  There can be
              multiple occurences of the AA field.  The  order  is
              siginificant.   It  is a good idea always to supply
              an AA field or a QQ field.

       BB      For an article that is part of a book, the title of
              the book

       CC      The place (city) of publication.

       DD      The date of publication.  The year should be speci-
              fied in full.  If the month is specified, the  name
              rather than the number of the month should be used,
              but only the first three letters are required.   It

              is  a  good idea always to supply a DD field; if the
              date is unknown,  a  value  such  as  iinn  pprreessss  or
              uunnkknnoowwnn can be used.

       EE      For  an article that is part of a book, the name of
              an editor of the book.  Where the work has  editors
              and  no authors, the names of the editors should be
              given as AA fields and ,, ((eedd)) or ,, ((eeddss))  should  be
              appended to the last author.

       GG      US Government ordering number.

       II      The publisher (issuer).

       JJ      For  an article in a journal, the name of the jour-
              nal.

       KK      Keywords to be used for searching.

       LL      Label.

       NN      Journal issue number.

       OO      Other information.  This is usually printed at  the
              end of the reference.

       PP      Page  number.  A range of pages can be specified as
              _m--_n.

       QQ      The name of the author, if the author is not a per-
              son.   This  will  only  be  used if there are no AA
              fields.  There can only be one QQ field.

       RR      Technical report number.

       SS      Series name.

       TT      Title.  For an article in a book or  journal,  this
              should be the title of the article.

       VV      Volume number of the journal or book.

       XX      Annotation.

       For  all  fields except AA and EE, if there is more than one
       occurence of a particular field in a record, only the last
       such field will be used.

       If  accent  strings  are  used,  they  should  follow  the
       charater to be accented.  This means  that  the  AAMM  macro
       must  be  used with the --mmss macros.  Accent strings should

       The _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t, _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t and  _f_l_a_g_s  components  are
       optional.   Only one of the _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s and _f_i_e_l_d_s components
       need be specified.

       The _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s component says to  search  the  bibliographic
       databases  for  a reference that contains all the words in
       _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s.  It is an error if more than  one  reference  if
       found.

       The  _f_i_e_l_d_s  components  specifies  additional  fields  to
       replace or supplement those specified  in  the  reference.
       When  references  are  being  accumulated and the _k_e_y_w_o_r_d_s
       component is non-empty, then additional fields  should  be
       specified  only  on  the  first occasion that a particular
       reference is cited, and will apply  to  all  citations  of
       that reference.

       The  _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t  and  _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t  component  specifies
       strings to be used to bracket the  label  instead  of  the
       strings specified in the bbrraacckkeett--llaabbeell command.  If either
       of these components is non-empty, the strings specified in
       the bbrraacckkeett--llaabbeell command will not be used; this behaviour
       can be altered using the [[ and ]] flags.  Note that leading
       and  trailing spaces are significant for these components.

       The _f_l_a_g_s component is a list of non-alphanumeric  charac-
       ters each of which modifies the treatment of this particu-
       lar citation.  Unix refer will treat these flags  as  part
       of  the  keywords  and  so will ignore them since they are
       non-alphanumeric.  The following flags are currently  rec-
       ognized:

       ##      This  says to use the label specified by the sshhoorrtt--
              llaabbeell command, instead of  that  specified  by  the
              llaabbeell  command.   If no short label has been speci-
              fied, the normal label will be used.  Typically the
              short  label  is  used  with author-date labels and
              consists of only the date  and  possibly  a  disam-
              biguating  letter;  the ## is supposed to be sugges-
              tive of a numeric type of label.

       [[      Precede  _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t   with   the   first   string

       ]]      Follow  _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t  with the second string speci-
              fied in the bbrraacckkeett--llaabbeell command.

       One advantages of using the [[  and  ]]  flags  rather  than
       including the brackets in _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t and _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t is
       that you can change the style of bracket used in the docu-
       ment  just by changing the bbrraacckkeett--llaabbeell command.  Another
       advantage is that sorting and merging  of  citations  will
       not necessarily be inhibited if the flags are used.

       If  a  label  is  to be inserted into the text, it will be
       attached to the line preceding the ..[[ line.  If  there  is
       no  such  line, then an extra line will be inserted before
       the ..[[ line and a warning will be given.

       There is no special notation for making a citation to mul-
       tiple  references.   Just use a sequence of citations, one
       for each reference.  Don't put anything between the  cita-
       tions.   The labels for all the citations will be attached
       to the line preceding the first citation.  The labels  may
       also  be  sorted or merged.  See the description of the <<>>
       label expression,  and  of  the  ssoorrtt--aaddjjaacceenntt--llaabbeellss  and
       aabbbbrreevviiaattee--llaabbeell--rraannggeess  command.   A  label  will  not be
       merged if its citation has  a  non-empty  _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t  or
       _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t.   However,  the  labels for a citation using
       the ]] flag and without any _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t  immediately  fol-
       lowed by a citation using the [[ flag and without any _o_p_e_n_-
       _i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t may be sorted and merged even  though  the  first
       citation's  _o_p_e_n_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t or the second citation's _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-
       _t_e_x_t is non-empty.  (If you wish to prevent this just make
       the first citation's _c_l_o_s_i_n_g_-_t_e_x_t \\&&.)

       Commands are contained between lines starting with ..RR11 and
       ..RR22.  Recognition of these lines can be prevented  by  the
       --RR  option.  When a ..RR11 line is recognized any accumulated
       references are flushed out.  Neither ..RR11  nor  ..RR22  lines,
       nor anything between them is output.

       Commands  are separated by newlines or ;;s.  ## introduces a
       comment that extends to the end of the line (but does  not
       conceal  the  newline).   Each  command  is broken up into
       words.  Words are separated by spaces  or  tabs.   A  word
       that  begins with "" extends to the next "" that is not fol-
       lowed by another "".  If  there  is  no  such  ""  the  word
       extends  to  the  end  of  the line.  Pairs of "" in a word
       beginning with "" collapse to a single "".  Neither ## nor  ;;
       are recognized inside ""s.  A line can be continued by end-
       ing it with \\; this works everywhere except after a ##.

       Each command _n_a_m_e that is marked with * has an  associated
       negative  command  nnoo--_n_a_m_e that undoes the effect of _n_a_m_e.
       For example, the nnoo--ssoorrtt command specifies that references
       should not be sorted.  The negative commands take no argu-
       ments.

       In the following description each argument must be a  sin-
       gle  word;  _f_i_e_l_d is used for a single upper or lower case
       letter naming a field; _f_i_e_l_d_s is used for  a  sequence  of
       such letters; _m and _n are used for a non-negative numbers;
       _s_t_r_i_n_g is used for an arbitrary string; _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is  used
       for the name of a file.

                                Abbreviate  the  first  names  of
                                _f_i_e_l_d_s.  An initial  letter  will
                                be separated from another initial
                                letter by _s_t_r_i_n_g_1, from the  last
                                name  by  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2,  and from any-
                                thing else (such as a vvoonn or  ddee)
                                by  _s_t_r_i_n_g_3.   These default to a
                                period followed by a space.  In a
                                hyphenated  first  name, the ini-

                                name  will  be separated from the
                                hyphen by _s_t_r_i_n_g_4; this  defaults
                                to  a period.  No attempt is made
                                to handle  any  ambiguities  that
                                might  result  from abbreviation.
                                Names  are   abbreviated   before
                                sorting  and  before  label  con-
                                struction.

       Label expressions can be evaluated both normally and  ten-

       output.  The result of tentative  evaluation,  called  the
       _t_e_n_t_a_t_i_v_e  _l_a_b_e_l_,  is  used to gather the information that

       ''_s_t_r_i_n_g''
              The characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g literally.

       @@      All  the  authors  joined as specified by the jjooiinn--
              aauutthhoorrss command.  The whole of each  author's  name
              will  be  used.   However,  if  the  references are
              sorted by author (that is  the  sort  specification
              starts  with  AA++), then authors' last names will be
              used instead, provided that this does not introduce
              ambiguity,  and  also an initial subsequence of the
              authors may be used instead  of  all  the  authors,
              again provided that this does not introduce ambigu-
              ity.  The use of only the last name  for  the  _i-th
              author  of  some  reference  is  considered  to  be
              ambiguous if there is some  other  reference,  such
              that  the  first  _i-1 authors of the references are
              the same, the _i-th authors are not  the  same,  but
              the  _i-th  authors'  last  names  are  the same.  A
              proper  initial  subsequence  of  the  sequence  of
              authors  for  some  reference  is  considered to be
              ambiguous if there is a reference with  some  other
              sequence of authors which also has that subsequence
              as a proper initial subsequence.  When  an  initial
              subsequence  of  authors  is  used,  the  remaining
              authors are replaced by the string specified by the
              eett--aall  command; this command may also specify addi-
              tional requirements that must be met before an ini-
              tial subsequence can be used.  @@ tentatively evalu-
              ates to a canonical representation of the  authors,
              such  that authors that compare equally for sorting
              purpose will have the same representation.

              serial number of a reference is 1 plus  the  number
              of  earlier references with same tentative label as
              this  reference.   These  expressions   tentatively
              evaluate to an empty string.

              comma followed by a  space);  the  resulting  label
              will  also  be a two-part label with the same first
              part as before merging, and  so  additional  labels
              can be merged into it.  Note that it is permissible
              for the first part to be empty; this  maybe  desir-
              able  for  expressions used in the sshhoorrtt--llaabbeell com-
              mand.

       ((_e_x_p_r)) The same as _e_x_p_r.  Used for grouping.

       The above expressions are listed in  order  of  precedence
       (highest first); && and || have the same precedence.

       Each  reference  starts  with a call to the macro ]]--.  The
       string [[FF will be defined to be the label for this  refer-
       ence,  unless  the  nnoo--llaabbeell--iinn--rreeffeerreennccee command has been
       given.  There then follows a series of string definitions,
       one for each field: string [[_X corresponds to field _X.  The
       number register [[PP is set to 1 if the PP field  contains  a
       range  of  pages.   The [[TT, [[AA and [[OO number registers are
       set to 1 according as the TT, AA and OO fields end  with  one
       of the characters ..??!!.  The [[EE number register will be set
       to 1 if the [[EE string contains more than  one  name.   The
       reference  is  followed  by  a  call to the ]][[ macro.  The
       first argument to this macro gives a  number  representing
       the  type  of  the reference.  If a reference contains a JJ
       field, it will be classified as type 1,  otherwise  if  it
       contains  a  BB field, it will type 3, otherwise if it con-
       tains a GG or RR field it will be type 4, otherwise if  con-
       tains  a  II  field it will be type 2, otherwise it will be
       type 0.  The second argument is a symbolic  name  for  the
       type:  ootthheerr,  jjoouurrnnaall--aarrttiiccllee,  bbooookk,  aarrttiiccllee--iinn--bbooookk or
       tteecchh--rreeppoorrtt.  Groups of references that have been  accumu-
       lated or are produced by the bbiibblliiooggrraapphhyy command are pre-
       ceded by a call to the ]]<< macro and followed by a call  to
       the ]]>> macro.
