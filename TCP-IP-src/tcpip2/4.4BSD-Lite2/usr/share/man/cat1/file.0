     FFiillee tests the specified files and attempts to classify them.  If a file
     is a text file, it attempts to determine the type of text (e.g.  csh(1)
     commands or C source code).

     The options are as follows:

     --hh      If a symbolic link is specified, identify the file as a symbolic
             link.  By default, symbolic links are only identified if they
             reference non-existent files.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     Previous implementations of the ffiillee utility did not follow symbolic
     links by default.

BBUUGGSS
     As many tests are used and ffiillee stops testing on the first successful
     one, it can often make mistakes.
