     SSttyyllee analyzes the surface characteristics of the writing style of a doc-
     ument.  It reports on readability, sentence length and structure, word
     length and usage, verb type, and sentence openers.  Because ssttyyllee runs
     deroff before looking at the text, formatting header files should be in-
     cluded as part of the input.

     Options available:

     --aa        print all sentences with their length and readability index.

     --ee        print all sentences that begin with an expletive.

     --pp        print all sentences that contain a passive verb.

     --ll _n_u_m    print all sentences longer than _n_u_m.

     --mmll       The flag --mmll, which causes deroff to skip lists, should be used
               if the document contains many lists of non-sentences.

     --mmmm       The default macro package --mmss may be overridden with the flag
               --mmmm.

     --rr _n_u_m    print all sentences whose readability index is greater than
               _n_u_m.

     --PP        print parts of speech of the words in the document.
