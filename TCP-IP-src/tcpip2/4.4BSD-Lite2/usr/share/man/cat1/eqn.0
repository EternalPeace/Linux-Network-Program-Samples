       This manual page describes the GNU version of  eeqqnn,  which
       is part of the groff document formatting system.  eeqqnn com-
       piles descriptions  of  equations  embedded  within  ttrrooffff
       input  files  into  commands that are understood by ttrrooffff.
       Normally, it should be invoked  using  the  --ee  option  of
       ggrrooffff.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The
       output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff;  it
       must  be  processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given
       on the command line, the standard input will be  read.   A
       filename of -- will cause the standard input to be read.

       eeqqnn   searches   for   the   file  eeqqnnrrcc  using  the  path
       ..:://uussrr//sshhaarree//ttmmaacc:://uussrr//sshhaarree//ttmmaacc.  If it exists, eqn will
       process  it  before  the other input files.  The --RR option
       prevents this.

       GNU eqn does not provide the  functionality  of  neqn:  it
       does  not  support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
       (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --CC     Recognize ..EEQQ and ..EENN even when followed by a char-
              acter other than space or newline.

       --NN     Don't   allow  newlines  within  delimiters.   This
              option allows eeqqnn to recover  better  from  missing
              closing delimiters.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       --rr     Only one size reduction.

       --mm_n    The  minimum  point-size is _n.  eqn will not reduce
              the size of subscripts or superscripts to a smaller
              size than _n.

       --TT_n_a_m_e The  output is for device _n_a_m_e.  The only effect of
              this is to define a macro _n_a_m_e with a value  of  11.
              Typically  eeqqnnrrcc  will  use this to provide defini-
              tions  appropriate  for  the  output  device.   The
              default output device is ppss.

       --MM_d_i_r  Search   _d_i_r   for   eeqqnnrrcc   before   the   default

       --RR     Don't load eeqqnnrrcc.

       --ff_F    This is equivalent to a ggffoonntt _F command.

       --ss_n    This is equivalent  to  a  ggssiizzee _n  command.   This
              option  is deprecated.  eqn will normally set equa-
              tions at whatever the current point  size  is  when
              the equation is encountered.

       --pp_n    This  says  that subscripts and superscripts should
              be _n points  smaller  than  the  surrounding  text.
              This option is deprecated.  Normally eqn makes sets
              subscripts and superscripts at 70% of the  size  of
              the surrounding text.

UUSSAAGGEE
       Only  the  differences  between  GNU  eqn and Unix eqn are
       described here.

       Most of the new features of GNU  eqn  are  based  on  TeX.
       There  are  some references to the differences between TeX
       and GNU eqn below; these may safely be ignored if  you  do
       not know TeX.

   AAuuttoommaattiicc ssppaacciinngg
       eeqqnn  gives  each  component  of  an  equation  a type, and
       adjusts the spacing between components  using  that  type.
       Possible types are:

       ordinary     an ordinary character such as 1 or _x;
                                             _
       operator     a large operator such as _>;

       binary       a binary operator such as +;

       relation     a relation such as =;

       opening      a opening bracket such as (;

       closing      a closing bracket such as );

       punctuation  a punctutation character such as ,;

       inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

       suppress     spacing  that  suppresses  automatic  spacing
                    adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       ttyyppee _t _e
              This yields an equation component that  contains  _e
              but  that  has  type _t, where _t is one of the types
              mentioned above.  For example, ttiimmeess is defined as

                     ttyyppee ""bbiinnaarryy"" \\((mmuu

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but
              quoting protects from macro expansion.

       cchhaarrttyyppee _t _t_e_x_t
              Unquoted  groups  of  characters  are split up into
              individual characters, and the type of each charac-
              ter  is  looked  up;  this changes the type that is
              stored for each character; it says that the charac-
              ters in _t_e_x_t from now on have type _t.  For example,

                     cchhaarrttyyppee ""ppuunnccttuuaattiioonn"" ..,,;;::

              would make the characters ..,,;;:: have  type  punctua-
              tion  whenever  they  subsequently  appeared  in an
              equation.  The type _t can also be lleetttteerr or  ddiiggiitt;
              in  these  cases  cchhaarrttyyppee changes the font type of
              the characters.  See the Fonts subsection.

   NNeeww pprriimmiittiivveess
       _e_1 ssmmaalllloovveerr _e_2
              This is similar to oovveerr; ssmmaalllloovveerr reduces the size
              of  _e_1  and  _e_2;  it  also puts less vertical space
              between _e_1 or _e_2 and the fraction  bar.   The  oovveerr
              primitive corresponds to the TeX \\oovveerr primitive in
              display styles; ssmmaalllloovveerr corresponds to  \\oovveerr  in
              non-display styles.

       vvcceenntteerr _e
              This vertically centers _e about the math axis.  The
              math axis is  the  vertical  position  about  which
              characters such as + and - are centered; also it is
              the vertical position used for  the  bar  of  frac-
              tions.  For example, ssuumm is defined as

                     {{ ttyyppee ""ooppeerraattoorr"" vvcceenntteerr ssiizzee ++55 \\((**SS }}

       _e_1 aacccceenntt _e_2
              This  sets  _e_2 as an accent over _e_1.  _e_2 is assumed
              to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
              _e_2  will be moved down according if _e_1 is taller or
              shorter than a lowercase letter.  For example,  hhaatt
              is defined as

                     aacccceenntt {{ ""^^"" }}

              ddoottddoott,  ddoott,  ttiillddee, vveecc and ddyyaadd are also defined
              using the aacccceenntt primitive.

       _e_1 uuaacccceenntt _e_2
              This sets _e_2 as an accent under _e_1.  _e_2 is  assumed
              to be at the correct height for a character without
              a descender; _e_2 will be moved  down  if  _e_1  has  a
              descender.   uuttiillddee is pre-defined using uuaacccceenntt as
              a tilde accent below the baseline.

       sspplliitt ""_t_e_x_t""
              This has the same effect as simply

                     _t_e_x_t

              but _t_e_x_t is not subject to macro expansion  because
              it is quoted; _t_e_x_t will be split up and the spacing
              between individual characters will be adjusted.

       nnoosspplliitt _t_e_x_t
              This has the same effect as

                     ""_t_e_x_t""

              but because _t_e_x_t is not quoted it will  be  subject
              to  macro  expansion; _t_e_x_t will not be split up and
              the spacing between individual characters will  not
              be adjusted.

       _e oopppprriimmee
              This is a variant of pprriimmee that acts as an operator
              on _e.  It produces a different result from pprriimmee in
              a  case such as AA oopppprriimmee ssuubb 11: with oopppprriimmee the 11
              will be tucked under the prime as  a  subscript  to
              the  AA (as is conventional in mathematical typeset-
              ting), whereas with pprriimmee the 11 will be a subscript
              to  the prime character.  The precedence of oopppprriimmee
              is the same as that of  bbaarr  and  uunnddeerr,  which  is
              higher  than  that  of everything except aacccceenntt and
              uuaacccceenntt.  In unquoted text a  ''  that  is  not  the
              first character will be treated like oopppprriimmee.

       ssppeecciiaall _t_e_x_t _e
              This  constructs  a  new  object  from  _e  using  a
              ttrrooffff(1) macro  named  _t_e_x_t.   When  the  macro  is
              called,  the  string 00ss will contain the output for
              _e, and the number registers 00ww, 00hh, 00dd, 00sskkeerrnn  and
              00sskkeeww  will  contain the width, height, depth, sub-
              script kern, and skew of _e.  (The _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t _k_e_r_n of
              an  object says how much a subscript on that object
              should be tucked in; the _s_k_e_w of an object says how

              far  to  the  right  of the center of the object an
              accent over the  object  should  be  placed.)   The
              macro  must  modify  00ss  so that it will output the
              desired result  with  its  origin  at  the  current
              point, and increase the current horizontal position
              by the width of the object.  The  number  registers
              must  also  be  modified so that they correspond to
              the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted  a  construct  that
              `cancels'  an expression by drawing a diagonal line
              through it.

                     ..EEQQ

              Here's  a  more  complicated construct that draws a

              This sets parameter _p to value _n _; _n is an integer.

       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, $$_n where _n is
       between 1 and 9, will be replaced by the _n_-_t_h argument  if
       the  macro  is  called  with arguments; if there are fewer
       than _n arguments, it will be replaced by nothing.  A  word
       containing  a  left parenthesis where the part of the word
       before the left parenthesis has  been  defined  using  the
       ddeeffiinnee  command  will  be  recognized as a macro call with

       a  matching  right  parenthesis  will be treated as comma-
       separated arguments; commas inside nested  parentheses  do
       not terminate an argument.

              be recognized if called with arguments.

       iinncclluuddee ""_f_i_l_e""

              ning with ..EEQQ or ..EENN will be ignored.

              automatically defined because _n_a_m_e  is  the  output

       eeqqnn  normally  uses at least two fonts to set an equation:
       an italic font for letters, and a roman  font  for  every-
       thing  else.   The existing ggffoonntt command changes the font
       that is used as the italic font.  By default  this  is  II.
       The  font  that  is  used as the roman font can be changed
       using the new ggrrffoonntt command.

       ggrrffoonntt _f
              Set the roman font to _f.

       The iittaalliicc primitive uses the current italic font  set  by
       ggffoonntt; the rroommaann primitive uses the current roman font set
       by ggrrffoonntt.  There is also  a  new  ggbbffoonntt  command,  which
       changes  the font used by the bboolldd primitive.  If you only
       use the rroommaann, iittaalliicc and bboolldd primitives to changes fonts
       within  an  equation, you can change all the fonts used by
       your equations just by using ggffoonntt, ggrrffoonntt and ggbbffoonntt com-
       mands.

       You  can  control  which characters are treated as letters
       (and therefore set in italics) by using the cchhaarrttyyppee  com-
       mand described above.  A type of lleetttteerr will cause a char-
       acter to be set in italic type.   A  type  of  ddiiggiitt  will
       cause a character to be set in roman type.
