DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _L_a_m  copies the named files side by side onto the standard
       output.  The _n-th input lines from  the  input  _f_i_l_es  are
       considered  fragments  of the single long _n-th output line
       into which they are assembled.  The  name  `--'  means  the
       standard input, and may be repeated.

       Normally,  each option affects only the _f_i_l_e after it.  If
       the option letter is capitalized it affects all subsequent
       files  until  it appears again uncapitalized.  The options
       are described below.

       --ff min.max
              Print line fragments according to the format string
              _m_i_n_._m_a_x,  where  _m_i_n is the minimum field width and
              _m_a_x the maximum field width.  If _m_i_n begins with  a
              zero,  zeros  will  be  added  to make up the field
              width, and if it begins with a  `-',  the  fragment
              will be left-adjusted within the field.

       --pp min.max
              Like --ff, but pad this file's field when end-of-file
              is reached and other files are still active.

       --ss sepstring
              Print _s_e_p_s_t_r_i_n_g before printing line fragments from
              the  next  file.   This option may appear after the
              last file.

       --tt c   The input line terminator is _c instead  of  a  new-
              line.  The newline normally appended to each output
              line is omitted.

       To print files simultaneously for easy viewing use  _p_r(1).

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The command

              llaamm   ffiillee11   ffiillee22   ffiillee33   ffiillee44

       joins  4  files  together  along  each line.  To merge the
       lines from four different files use

              llaamm   ffiillee11   --SS   ""\\
              ""   ffiillee22   ffiillee33   ffiillee44

       Every 2 lines of a file may be joined on one line with

              llaamm   --   --   <<   ffiillee

       and a form letter with substitutions keyed by `@'  can  be
       done with
