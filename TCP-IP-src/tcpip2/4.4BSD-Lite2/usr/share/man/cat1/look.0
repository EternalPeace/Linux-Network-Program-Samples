     llooookk [--ddff] [--tt _t_e_r_m_c_h_a_r] _s_t_r_i_n_g [_f_i_l_e]

     The llooookk utility displays any lines in _f_i_l_e which contain _s_t_r_i_n_g as a
     prefix.  As llooookk performs a binary search, the lines in _f_i_l_e must be
     sorted.

     If _f_i_l_e is not specified, the file _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_i_c_t_/_w_o_r_d_s is used, only
     alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic charac-
     ters is ignored.

     Options:

     --dd      Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric char-
             acters are compared.

     --ff      Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.

     --tt      Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters
             in _s_t_r_i_n_g up to and including the first occurrence of _t_e_r_m_c_h_a_r
             are compared.

     The llooookk utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1
     if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.

     The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters partici-
     pated in comparisons when the --dd option was specified.  This was incor-
     rect and the current man page matches the historic implementation.
