DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     WWhhaatt reads each file _n_a_m_e and searches for sequences of the form ``@(#)''
     as inserted by the source code control system.  It prints the remainder
     of the string following this marker, up to a null character, newline,
     double quote, or ``> character.''

BBUUGGSS
     As BSD is not licensed to distribute SCCS this is a rewrite of the wwhhaatt
     command which is part of SCCS, and may not behave exactly the same as
     that command does.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The wwhhaatt command appeared in 4.0BSD.
