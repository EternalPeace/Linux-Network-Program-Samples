     CCoollrrmm removes selected columns from the lines of a file.  A column is de-
     fined as a single character in a line.  Input is read from the standard
     input.  Output is written to the standard output.

     If only the _s_t_a_r_t column is specified, columns numbered less than the
     _s_t_a_r_t column will be written.  If both _s_t_a_r_t and _s_t_o_p columns are speci-
     fied, columns numbered less than the _s_t_a_r_t column or greater than the
     _s_t_o_p column will be written.  Column numbering starts with one, not zero.

     Tab characters increment the column count to the next multiple of eight.
     Backspace characters decrement the column count by one.
