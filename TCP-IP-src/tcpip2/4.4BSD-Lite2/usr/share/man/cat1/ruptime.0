     RRuuppttiimmee gives a status line like _u_p_t_i_m_e for each machine on the local
     network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each host on the net-
     work once a minute.

     Machines for which no status report has been received for 11 minutes are
     shown as being down.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      Users idle an hour or more are not counted unless the --aa flag is
             given.

     --ll      Sort by load average.

     --rr      Reverses the sort order.

     --tt      Sort by uptime.

     --uu      Sort by number of users.

     The default listing is sorted by host name.
