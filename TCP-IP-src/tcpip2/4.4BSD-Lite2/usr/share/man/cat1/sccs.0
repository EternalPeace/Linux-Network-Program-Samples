     SSccccss is a front end to the SCCS programs that helps them mesh more clean-
     ly with the rest of UNIX.  It also includes the capability to run ``set
     user id'' to another user to provide additional protection.

     Basically, ssccccss runs the command with the specified _f_l_a_g_s and _a_r_g_s. Each
     argument is normally modified to be prepended with ``SCCS/s.''.

     Flags to be interpreted by the ssccccss program must be before the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
     argument.  Flags to be passed to the actual SCCS program must come after
     the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d argument.  These flags are specific to the command and are
     discussed in the documentation for that command.

     Besides the usual SCCS commands, several ``pseudo-commands'' can be is-
     sued.  These are:

     eeddiitt     Equivalent to ``get -e''.

     ddeellggeett   Perform a delta on the named files and then get new versions.
              The new versions will have id keywords expanded, and will not be
              editable.  The --mm, --pp, --rr, --ss, and --yy flags will be passed to
              ddeellttaa, and the --bb,, --cc, --ee, --ii, --kk, --ll, --ss, and --xx flags will be
              passed to get.

     ddeelleeddiitt  Equivalent to ddeellggeett except that the ggeett phase includes the --ee
              flag.  This option is useful for making a _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t of your
              current editing phase.  The same flags will be passed to delta
              as described above, and all the flags listed for above except --ee
              and --kk are passed to eeddiitt.

     ccrreeaattee   Creates an SCCS file , taking the initial contents from the file
              of the same name.  Any flags to aaddmmiinn are accepted.  If the cre-
              ation is successful, the files are renamed with a comma on the
              front.  These should be removed when you are convinced that the
              SCCS files have been created successfully.

     ffiixx      Must be followed by a --rr flag.  This command essentially removes
              the named delta, but leaves you with a copy of the delta with
              the changes that were in it.  It is useful for fixing small com-
              piler bugs, etc.  Since it doesn't leave audit trails, it should
              be used carefully.

     cclleeaann    This routine removes everything from the current directory that
              can be recreated from SCCS files.  It will not remove any files
              being edited.  If the --bb flag is given, branches are ignored in
              the determination of whether they are being edited; this is dan-
              gerous if you are keeping the branches in the same directory.

     uunneeddiitt   This is the opposite of an eeddiitt or a ``get -e''. It should be
              used with extreme caution, since any changes you made since the
              get will be irretrievably lost.

     iinnffoo     Gives a listing of all files being edited.  If the --bb flag is
              given, branches (i.e., SID's with two or fewer components) are
              ignored.  If the --uu flag is given (with an optional argument)
              then only files being edited by you (or the named user) are

              listed.

     cchheecckk    Like iinnffoo except that nothing is printed if nothing is being
              edited, and a non-zero exit status is returned if anything is
              being edited.  The intent is to have this included in an _i_n_s_t_a_l_l
              entry in a makefile to insure that everything is included into
              the SCCS file before a version is installed.

     tteellll     Gives a newline-separated list of the files being edited on the
              standard output.  Takes the --bb and --uu flags like iinnffoo and cchheecckk.

     ddiiffffss    Gives a ddiiffff listing between the current version of the pro-
              gram(s) you have out for editing and the versions in SCCS for-
              mat.  The --rr, --cc, --ii, --xx, and --tt flags are passed to
              ggeett; the --ll, --ss, --ee, --ff, --hh, and --bb options are passed to
              ddiiffff. The --CC flag is passed to ddiiffff as --cc.

     pprriinntt    This command prints out verbose information about the named
              files.

     --rr       Runs ssccccss as the real user rather than as whatever effective us-
              er ssccccss is ``set user id'' to.

     --dd       Specifies a root directory for the SCCS files.  The default is
              the current directory.  If environment variable PROJECT is set,
              it will be used to determine the --dd flag.

     --pp       Defines the pathname of the directory in which the SCCS files
              will be found; ``SCCS'' is the default.  The --pp flag differs
              from the --dd flag in that the --dd argument is prepended to the en-
              tire pathname and the --pp argument is inserted before the final
              component of the pathname.  For example, ``sccs -d/x -py get
              a/b'' will convert to ``get /x/a/y/s.b''. The intent here is to
              create aliases such as ``alias syssccs sccs -d/usr/src'' which
              will be used as ``syssccs get cmd/who.c''.

              Certain commands (such as aaddmmiinn) cannot be run ``set user id''
              by all users, since this would allow anyone to change the autho-
              rizations.  These commands are always run as the real user.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
     To get a file for editing, edit it, and produce a new delta:

           sccs get -e file.c
           ex file.c
           sccs delta file.c

     To get a file from another directory:

           sccs -p/usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c

     or

           sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c

     To make a delta of a large number of files in the current directory:

           sccs delta *.c

     To get a list of files being edited that are not on branches:

           sccs info -b

     To delta everything being edited by you:


           sccs delta `sccs tell -u`

     In a makefile, to get source files from an SCCS file if it does not al-
     ready exist:

           SRCS = <list of source files>
           $(SRCS):
                sccs get $(REL) $@

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     PROJECT       The PROJECT environment variable is checked by the --dd flag.
                   If it begins with a slash, it is taken directly; otherwise,
                   the home directory of a user of that name is examined for a
                   subdirectory ``src'' or ``source''. If such a directory is
                   found, it is used.

     The ssccccss command appeared in 4.3BSD.

BBUUGGSS
     It should be able to take directory arguments on pseudo-commands like the
     SCCS commands do.
