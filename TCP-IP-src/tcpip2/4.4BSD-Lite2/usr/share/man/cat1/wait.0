     If invoked with no arguments, the wwaaiitt utility waits until all existing
     child processes in the background have terminated.

     Available operands:

     _p_i_d     If a _p_i_d operand is specified, and it is the process ID of a
             background child process that still exists, the wwaaiitt utility
             waits until that process has completed and consumes its status
             information, without consuming the status information of any oth-
             er process.

             If a pid operand is specified that is not the process ID of a
             child background process that still exists, wwaaiitt exits without
             waiting for any processes to complete.

     The wwaaiitt utility exits with one of the following values:

     0       The wwaaiitt utility was invoked with no operands and all of the ex-
             isting background child processes have terminated, or the process
             specified by the pid operand exited normally with 0 as its exit
             status.

     >0      The specified process did not exist and its exit status informa-
             tion was not available, or the specified process existed or its
             exit status information was available, and it terminated with a
             non-zero exit status.

     If the specified process terminated abnormally due to the receipt of a
     signal, the exit status information of wwaaiitt contains that termination
     status as well.

     The wwaaiitt command is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
