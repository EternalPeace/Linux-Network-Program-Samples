     The nneettssttaatt command symbolically displays the contents of various net-
     work-related data structures.  There are a number of output formats, de-
     pending on the options for the information presented.  The first form of
     the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The
     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data struc-
     tures according to the option selected.  Using the third form, with a
     _w_a_i_t interval specified, nneettssttaatt will continuously display the informa-
     tion regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces.  The
     fourth form displays statistics about the named protocol.

     The options have the following meaning:

     --AA    With the default display, show the address of any protocol control
           blocks associated with sockets; used for debugging.

     --aa    With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
           sockets used by server processes are not shown.

     --dd    With either interface display (option --ii or an interval, as de-
           scribed below), show the number of dropped packets.

     --ff _a_d_d_r_e_s_s___f_a_m_i_l_y
           Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
           specified _a_d_d_r_e_s_s _f_a_m_i_l_y. The following address families are recog-
           nized: _i_n_e_t, for AF_INET, _n_s, for AF_NS, _i_s_o, for AF_ISO, and _u_n_i_x,
           for AF_UNIX.

     --gg    Show information related to multicast (group address) routing.  By
           default, show the IP Multicast virtual-interface and routing ta-
           bles.  If the --ss option is also present, show multicast routing
           statistics.

     --hh    Show the state of the IMP host table (obsolete).

     --II _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
           Show information about the specified interface; used with a _w_a_i_t
           interval as described below.

     --ii    Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured (in-
           terfaces statically configured into a system, but not located at
           boot time are not shown).  If the --aa options is also present, mul-
           ticast addresses currently in use are shown for each Ethernet in-
           terface and for each IP interface address.  Multicast addresses are
           shown on separate lines following the interface address with which
           they are associated.

     --MM    Extract values associated with the name list from the specified
           core instead of the default _/_d_e_v_/_k_m_e_m.

     --mm    Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the
           network manages a private pool of memory buffers).

     --NN    Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the de-

           fault _/_v_m_u_n_i_x.

     --nn    Show network addresses as numbers (normally nneettssttaatt interprets ad-
           dresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option
           may be used with any of the display formats.

     --pp _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l
           Show statistics about _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l, which is either a well-known name
           for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names and aliases
           are listed in the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l_s. A null response typically
           means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The program
           will complain if _p_r_o_t_o_c_o_l is unknown or if there is no statistics
           routine for it.

     --ss    Show per-protocol statistics.  If this option is repeated, counters
           with a value of zero are suppressed.

     --rr    Show the routing tables.  When --ss is also present, show routing
           statistics instead.

     --ww _w_a_i_t
           Show network interface statistics at intervals of _w_a_i_t seconds.

     The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and remote ad-
     dresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the in-
     ternal state of the protocol.  Address formats are of the form
     ``host.port'' or ``network.port'' if a socket's address specifies a net-
     work but no specific host address.  When known the host and network ad-
     dresses are displayed symbolically according to the data bases _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s
     and _/_e_t_c_/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k_s, respectively.  If a symbolic name for an address is
     unknown, or if the --nn option is specified, the address is printed numeri-
     cally, according to the address family.  For more information regarding
     the Internet ``dot format,'' refer to inet(3)).  Unspecified, or ``wild-
     card'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

     The interface display provides a table of cumulative statistics regarding
     packets transferred, errors, and collisions.  The network addresses of
     the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'') are also dis-
     played.

     The routing table display indicates the available routes and their sta-
     tus.  Each route consists of a destination host or network and a gateway
     to use in forwarding packets.  The flags field shows a collection of in-
     formation about the route stored as binary choices.  The individual flags
     are discussed in more detail in the route(8) and route(4) manual pages.
     The mapping between letters and flags is:

     1       RTF_PROTO2       Protocol specific routing flag #1
     2       RTF_PROTO1       Protocol specific routing flag #2
     B       RTF_BLACKHOLE    Just discard pkts (during updates)
     C       RTF_CLONING      Generate new routes on use
     D       RTF_DYNAMIC      Created dynamically (by redirect)
     G       RTF_GATEWAY      Destination requires forwarding by intermediary
     H       RTF_HOST         Host entry (net otherwise)
     L       RTF_LLINFO       Valid protocol to link address translation.
     M       RTF_MODIFIED     Modified dynamically (by redirect)
     R       RTF_REJECT       Host or net unreachable
     S       RTF_STATIC       Manually added
     U       RTF_UP           Route usable
     X       RTF_XRESOLVE     External daemon translates proto to link address

     Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local host;
     the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing in-
     terface.  The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the
     route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route
     for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a
     route while sending to the same destination.  The use field provides a
     count of the number of packets sent using that route.  The interface en-
     try indicates the network interface utilized for the route.

     When nneettssttaatt is invoked with the --ww option and a _w_a_i_t interval argument,
     it displays a running count of statistics related to network interfaces.
     An obsolescent version of this option used a numeric parameter with no
     option, and is currently supported for backward compatibility.  This dis-
     play consists of a column for the primary interface (the first interface
     found during autoconfiguration) and a column summarizing information for
     all interfaces.  The primary interface may be replaced with another in-
     terface with the --II option.  The first line of each screen of information
     contains a summary since the system was last rebooted.  Subsequent lines
     of output show values accumulated over the preceding interval.
