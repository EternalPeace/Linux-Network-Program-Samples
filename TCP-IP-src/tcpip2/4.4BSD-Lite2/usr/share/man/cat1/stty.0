     ssttttyy [--aa | --ee | --gg] [--ff _f_i_l_e] [operands]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The ssttttyy utility sets or reports on terminal characteristics for the de-
     vice that is its standard input.  If no options or operands are speci-
     fied, it reports the settings of a subset of characteristics as well as
     additional ones if they differ from their default values.  Otherwise it
     modifies the terminal state according to the specified arguments.  Some
     combinations of arguments are mutually exclusive on some terminal types.

     The following options are available:

     --aa      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output as per IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'').

     --ee      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output in the traditional BSD ``all'' and ``everything'' formats.

     --ff      Open and use the terminal named by _f_i_l_e rather than using stan-
             dard input.  The file is opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag of
             ooppeenn(), making it possible to set or display settings on a termi-
             nal that might otherwise block on the open.

     --gg      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard
             output in a form that may be used as an argument to a subsequent
             invocation of ssttttyy to restore the current terminal state as per
             IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'').

     The following arguments are available to set the terminal characteris-
     tics:

   CCoonnttrrooll MMooddeess::

     Control mode flags affect hardware characteristics associated with the
     terminal.  This corresponds to the c_cflag in the termios structure.

     ppaarreennbb (--ppaarreennbb)
                 Enable (disable) parity generation and detection.

     ppaarroodddd (--ppaarroodddd)
                 Select odd (even) parity.

     ccss55 ccss66 ccss77 ccss88
                 Select character size, if possible.

     _n_u_m_b_e_r      Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if possible.  If
                 the baud rate is set to zero, modem control is no longer as-
                 serted.

     iissppeeeedd _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 Set terminal input baud rate to the number given, if possi-
                 ble.  If the input baud rate is set to zero, the input baud
                 rate is set to the value of the output baud rate.

     oossppeeeedd _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 Set terminal output baud rate to the number given, if possi-
                 ble.  If the output baud rate is set to zero, modem control



                 is no longer asserted.

     ssppeeeedd _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 This sets both iissppeeeedd and oossppeeeedd to _n_u_m_b_e_r.

     hhuuppccll (--hhuuppccll)
                 Stop asserting modem control (do not stop asserting modem
                 control) on last close.

     hhuupp (--hhuupp)  Same as hupcl (--hhuuppccll).

     ccssttooppbb (--ccssttooppbb)
                 Use two (one) stop bits per character.

     ccrreeaadd (--ccrreeaadd)
                 Enable (disable) the receiver.

     ccllooccaall (--ccllooccaall)
                 Assume a line without (with) modem control.

     ccrrttssccttss (--ccrrttssccttss)
                 Enable RTS/CTS flow control.

   IInnppuutt MMooddeess::
     This corresponds to the c_iflag in the termios structure.

     iiggnnbbrrkk (--iiggnnbbrrkk)
                 Ignore (do not ignore) break on input.

     bbrrkkiinntt (--bbrrkkiinntt)
                 Signal (do not signal) INTR on break.

     iiggnnppaarr (--iiggnnppaarr)
                 Ignore (do not ignore) parity errors.

     ppaarrmmrrkk (--ppaarrmmrrkk)
                 Mark (do not mark) parity errors.

     iinnppcckk (--iinnppcckk)
                 Enable (disable) input parity checking.

     iissttrriipp (--iissttrriipp)
                 Strip (do not strip) input characters to seven bits.

     iinnllccrr (--iinnllccrr)
                 Map (do not map) NL to CR on input.

     iiggnnccrr (--iiggnnccrr)
                 Ignore (do not ignore) CR on input.

     iiccrrnnll (--iiccrrnnll)
                 Map (do not map) CR to NL on input.

     iixxoonn (--iixxoonn)
                 Enable (disable) START/STOP output control.  Output from the
                 system is stopped when the system receives STOP and started
                 when the system receives START, or if iixxaannyy is set, any char-
                 acter restarts output.

     iixxooffff (--iixxooffff)
                 Request that the system send (not send) START/STOP characters
                 when the input queue is nearly empty/full.

     iixxaannyy (--iixxaannyy)

                 Allow any character (allow only START) to restart output.

     iimmaaxxbbeell (--iimmaaxxbbeell)
                 The system imposes a limit of MAX_INPUT (currently 255) char-
                 acters in the input queue.  If iimmaaxxbbeell is set and the input
                 queue limit has been reached, subsequent input causes the
                 system to send an ASCII BEL character to the output queue
                 (the terminal beeps at you).  Otherwise, if iimmaaxxbbeell is unset
                 and the input queue is full, the next input character causes
                 the entire input and output queues to be discarded.

   OOuuttppuutt MMooddeess::
     This corresponds to the c_oflag of the termios structure.

     ooppoosstt (--ooppoosstt)
                 Post-process output (do not post-process output; ignore all
                 other output modes).

     oonnllccrr (--oonnllccrr)
                 Map (do not map) NL to on output.

     ooxxttaabbss (--ooxxttaabbss)
                 Expand (do not expand) tabs to spaces on output.

   LLooccaall MMooddeess::

     Local mode flags (lflags) affect various and sundry characteristics of
     terminal processing.  Historically the term "local" pertained to new job
     control features implemented by Jim Kulp on a Pdp 11/70 at IIASA. Later
     the driver ran on the first VAX at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley, where the job
     control details were greatly modified but the structure definitions and
     names remained essentially unchanged.  The second interpretation of the
     'l' in lflag is ``line discipline flag'' which corresponds to the _c___l_f_l_a_g
     of the _t_e_r_m_i_o_s structure.

     iissiigg (--iissiigg)
                 Enable (disable) the checking of characters against the spe-
                 cial control characters INTR, QUIT, and SUSP.

     iiccaannoonn (--iiccaannoonn)
                 Enable (disable) canonical input (ERASE and KILL processing).

     iieexxtteenn (--iieexxtteenn)
                 Enable (disable) any implementation defined special control
                 characters not currently controlled by icanon, isig, or ixon.

     eecchhoo (--eecchhoo)
                 Echo back (do not echo back) every character typed.

     eecchhooee (--eecchhooee)
                 The ERASE character shall (shall not) visually erase the last
                 character in the current line from the display, if possible.

     eecchhookk (--eecchhookk)
                 Echo (do not echo) NL after KILL character.

     eecchhookkee (--eecchhookkee)
                 The KILL character shall (shall not) visually erase the the
                 current line from the display, if possible.

     eecchhoonnll (--eecchhoonnll)
                 Echo (do not echo) NL, even if echo is disabled.

     eecchhooccttll (--eecchhooccttll)
                 If eecchhooccttll is set, echo control characters as ^X.  Otherwise

                 control characters echo as themselves.

     eecchhoopprrtt (--eecchhoopprrtt)
                 For printing terminals. If set, echo erased characters back-
                 wards within ``\'' and ``/''.  Otherwise, disable this fea-
                 ture.

     nnooffllsshh (--nnooffllsshh)
                 Disable (enable) flush after INTR, QUIT, SUSP.

     ttoossttoopp (--ttoossttoopp)
                 Send (do not send) SIGTTOU for background output.  This caus-
                 es background jobs to stop if they attempt terminal output.

     aallttwweerraassee (--aallttwweerraassee)
                 Use (do not use) an alternate word erase algorithm when pro-
                 cessing WERASE characters.  This alternate algorithm consid-
                 ers sequences of alphanumeric/underscores as words.  It also
                 skips the first preceding character in its classification (as
                 a convenience since the one preceding character could have
                 been erased with simply an ERASE character.)

     mmddmmbbuuff (--mmddmmbbuuff)
                 If set, flow control output based on condition of Carrier De-
                 tect.  Otherwise writes return an error if Carrier Detect is
                 low (and Carrier is not being ignored with the CLOCAL flag.)

     fflluusshhoo (--fflluusshhoo)
                 Indicates output is (is not) being discarded.

     ppeennddiinn (--ppeennddiinn)
                 Indicates input is (is not) pending after a switch from non-
                 canonical to canonical mode and will be re-input when a read
                 becomes pending or more input arrives.

                 Set _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r to _s_t_r_i_n_g. If string is a single char-
                 acter, the control character is set to that character.  If
                 string is the two character sequence "^-" or the string "un-
                 def" the control character is disabled (i.e. set to

     ttiimmee _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 Set the value of min or time to number.  MIN and TIME are
                 used in Non-Canonical mode input processing (-icanon).

     --ppaarriittyy, --eevveennpp, --ooddddpp
                 Disable parenb, and set cs8.

     nnll (--nnll)    Enable (disable) icrnl.  In addition -nl unsets inlcr and
                 igncr.

     eekk          Reset ERASE and KILL characters back to system defaults.

     ssaannee        Resets all modes to reasonable values for interactive termi-
                 nal use.

     kkeerrnniinnffoo (--kkeerrnniinnffoo)
                 Enable (disable) the system generated status line associated
                 with processing a STATUS character (usually set to ^T).  The
                 status line consists of the system load average, the current
                 command name, its process ID, the event the process is wait-
                 ing on (or the status of the process), the user and system
                 times, percent cpu, and current memory usage.

     ccoolluummnnss _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 The terminal size is recorded as having _n_u_m_b_e_r columns.

     ccoollss _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 is an alias for ccoolluummnnss..

     rroowwss _n_u_m_b_e_r
                 The terminal size is recorded as having _n_u_m_b_e_r rows.

     ddeecc         Set modes suitable for users of Digital Equipment Corporation
                 systems ( ERASE, KILL, and INTR characters are set to ^?, ^U,
                 and ^C; ixany is disabled, and crt is enabled.)

     eexxttpprroocc (--eexxttpprroocc)
                 If set, this flag indicates that some amount of terminal pro-
                 cessing is being performed by either the terminal hardware or
                 by the remote side connected to a pty.

     rraaww (--rraaww)  If set, change the modes of the terminal so that no input or
                 output processing is performed. If unset, change the modes of
                 the terminal to some reasonable state that performs input and
                 output processing.  Note that since the terminal driver no
                 longer has a single RAW bit, it is not possible to intuit
                 what flags were set prior to setting rraaww. This means that un-
                 setting rraaww may not put back all the setting that were previ-
                 ously in effect.  To set the terminal into a raw state and
                 then accurately restore it, the following shell code is rec-
                 ommended:

                 save_state=$(stty -g)
                 stty raw
                 ...
                 stty "$save_state"


     ssiizzee        The size of the terminal is printed as two numbers on a sin-
                 gle line, first rows, then columns.

     These modes remain for compatibility with the previous version of the
     stty command.
