       The  _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r  command is used to register a new user with
       Kerberos.  The Kerberos server  keeps  record  of  certain
       trusted hosts from which it will accept new registrations.
       If the host on which _r_e_g_i_s_t_e_r is run is  trusted  by  Ker-
       beros,  the  user  is  asked for his current password, and
       then a new password to be used with Kerberos.  A user  may
       only register with Kerberos one time.
