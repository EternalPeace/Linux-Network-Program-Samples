       iinnddxxbbiibb  makes  an  inverted  index  for the bibliographic
       databases in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e...  for  use  with  rreeffeerr(1),  llooookk--
       bbiibb(1), and llkkbbiibb(1).  The index will be named _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e..ii;
       the index is written to a temporary  file  which  is  then
       renamed to this.  If no filenames are given on the command
       line because the --ff option has been used, and no --oo option
       is given, the index will be named IInndd..ii.

       Bibliographic  databases are divided into records by blank
       lines.  Within a record, each fields starts with a %% char-
       acter  at the beginning of a line.  Fields have a one let-
       ter name which follows the %% character.

       The values set by the --cc, --nn, --ll and --tt options are stored
       in  the  index;  when  the index is searched, keys will be
       discarded and truncated in a manner appropriate  to  these
       options; the original keys will be used for verifying that
       any record found using the  index  actually  contains  the
       keys.   This  means  that a user of an index need not know
       whether these options were used in  the  creation  of  the
       index,  provided  that not all the keys to be searched for
       would have been discarded during  indexing  and  that  the
       user  supplies  at  least  the part of each key that would
       have remained after being truncated during indexing.   The
       value set by the --ii option is also stored in the index and
       will be used in verifying records found using the index.

       --ww     Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

       --cc_f_i_l_e Read  the list of common words from _f_i_l_e instead of
              //uussrr//sshhaarree//mmiisscc//eeiiggnn.

       --dd_d_i_r  Use _d_i_r as the  pathname  of  the  current  working
              directory  to  store  in  the index, instead of the
              path printed by ppwwdd(1).  Usually _d_i_r will be a sym-
              bolic  link that points to the directory printed by
              ppwwdd(1).

       --ff_f_i_l_e Read the files to be indexed from _f_i_l_e.  If _f_i_l_e is

              --, files will be read from the standard input.  The
              --ff option can be given at most once.

       --ii_s_t_r_i_n_g
              Don't index the contents of fields whose names  are
              in _s_t_r_i_n_g.  Initially _s_t_r_i_n_g is XXYYZZ.

       --hh_n    Use  the first prime greater than or equal to _n for
              the size of the hash table.   Larger  values  of  _n
              will  usually  make searching faster, but will make
              the index larger and iinnddxxbbiibb use more memory.  Ini-
              tially _n is 997.

       --kk_n    Use  at  most _n keys per input record.  Initially _n
              is 100.

       --ll_n    Discard keys that are shorter than _n.  Initially  _n
              is 3.

       --nn_n    Discard  the  _n  most common words.  Initially _n is
              100.

       --oo_b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e
              The index should be named _b_a_s_e_n_a_m_e..ii.

       --tt_n    Truncate keys to _n.  Initially _n is 6.
