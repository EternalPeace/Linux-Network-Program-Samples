     MMtt is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.  By default mmtt per-
     forms the requested operation once.  Operations may be performed multiple
     times by specifying _c_o_u_n_t. Note that _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e must reference a raw (not
     block) tape device.

     The available commands are listed below.  Only as many characters as are
     required to uniquely identify a command need be specified.

     eeooff, wweeooff  Write _c_o_u_n_t end-of-file marks at the current position on the
                tape.

     ffssff        Forward space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     ffssrr        Forward space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     bbssff        Back space _c_o_u_n_t files.

     bbssrr        Back space _c_o_u_n_t records.

     rreewwiinndd     Rewind the tape (Count is ignored).

     oofffflliinnee, rreewwooffffll
                Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (Count is ig-
                nored).

     ssttaattuuss     Print status information about the tape unit.

     If a tape name is not specified, and the environment variable TAPE does
     not exist; mmtt uses the device _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_t_1_2.

     MMtt returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful, 1 if
     the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.

     If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by mmtt.

     TAPE        MMtt checks the TAPE environment variable if the argument
                 _t_a_p_e_n_a_m_e is not given.
