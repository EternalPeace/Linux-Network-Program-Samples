     GGccoorree creates a core image of the specified process, suitable for use
     with gdb(1).  By default, the core is written to the file ``_c_o_r_e_._<_p_i_d_>''.
     Both the executable image, _e_x_e_c, and the process identifier, _p_i_d, must be
     given on the command line.

     The options are:

     --cc      Write the core file to the specified file instead of
             ``_c_o_r_e_._<_p_i_d_>''.

     --ss      Stop the process while gathering the core image, and resume it
             when done.  This guarantees that the resulting core dump will be
             in a consistent state.  The process is resumed even if it was al-
             ready stopped.  The same effect can be achieved manually with
             kill(1).

     GGccoorree appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Context switches or paging activity that occur while ggccoorree is running may
     cause the program to become confused.  For best results, use -s to tem-
     porarily stop the target process.

     GGccoorree is not compatible with the original 4.2BSD version.  In particular,
     4.4BSD requires the _e_x_e_c argument.
