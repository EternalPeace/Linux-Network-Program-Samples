     DDaattee displays the current date and time when invoked without arguments.
     Providing arguments will format the date and time in a user-defined way
     or set the date.  Only the superuser may set the date.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd      Set the kernel's value for daylight savings time.  If _d_s_t is non-
             zero, future calls to gettimeofday(2) will return a non-zero
             `tz_dsttime'.

     --nn      The utility timed(8) is used to synchronize the clocks on groups
             of machines.  By default, if timed is running, ddaattee will set the
             time on all of the machines in the local group.  The --nn option
             stops ddaattee from setting the time for other than the current ma-
             chine.

     --rr      Print out the date and time in _s_e_c_o_n_d_s from the Epoch.

     --tt      Set the kernel's value for minutes west of GMT. _M_i_n_u_t_e_s___w_e_s_t
             specifies the number of minutes returned in `tz_minuteswest' by
             future calls to gettimeofday(2).

     --uu      Display or set the date in UCT (universal) time.

     An operand with a leading plus (``+'') sign signals a user-defined format
     string which specifies the format in which to display the date and time.
     The format string may contain any of the conversion specifications de-
     scribed in the strftime(3) manual page, as well as any arbitrary text.  A
     <newline> character is always output after the characters specified by
     the format string.  The format string for the default display is:

           ``%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y''.

     If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as a
     value for setting the system's notion of the current date and time.  The
     canonical representation for setting the date and time is:

           _y_y      Year in abbreviated form (.e.g 89 for 1989).
           _m_m      Numeric month.  A number from 1 to 12.
           _d_d      Day, a number from 1 to 31.
           _h_h      Hour, a number from 0 to 23.
           _m_m      Minutes, a number from 0 to 59.
           _._s_s     Seconds, a number from 0 to 61 (59 plus a a maximum of two
                   leap seconds).

     Everything but the minutes is optional.

     Time changes for Daylight Saving and Standard time and leap seconds and
     years are handled automatically.

     The command:

           date ``+DATE: %m/%d/%y%nTIME: %H:%M:%S''


     will display:

           DATE: 11/21/87
           TIME: 13:36:16

     The command:

           date 8506131627

     sets the date to ``June 13, 1985, 4:27 PM''.

     The command:

           date 1432

     sets the time to 2:32 PM, without modifying the date.

     The following environment variables affect the execution of ddaattee:

     TZ
       The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See environ(7) for more in-
       formation.

FFIILLEESS
     /var/log/wtmp      A record of date resets and time changes.
     /var/log/messages  A record of the user setting the time.

     Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if unable to set the date, and 2 if able
     to set the local date, but unable to set it globally.

     Occasionally, when timed synchronizes the time on many hosts, the setting
     of a new time value may require more than a few seconds.  On these occa-
     sions, ddaattee prints: `Network time being set'. The message `Communication
     error with timed' occurs when the communication between ddaattee and timed
     fails.

BBUUGGSS
     The system attempts to keep the date in a format closely compatible with
     VMS. VMS, however, uses local time (rather than GMT) and does not under-
     stand daylight-savings time.  Thus, if you use both UNIX and VMS, VMS
     will be running on GMT.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS
     The ddaattee command is expected to be compatible with IEEE Std1003.2
     (``POSIX'').
