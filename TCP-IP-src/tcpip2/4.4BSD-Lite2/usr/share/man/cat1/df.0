     DDff displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the speci-
     fied _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m or on the filesystem of which _f_i_l_e is a part.  Values are
     displayed in 512-byte per block block counts.  If neither a file or a
     filesystem operand is specified, statistics for all mounted filesystems
     are displayed (subject to the --tt option below).

     The following options are available:

     --ii      Include statistics on the number of free inodes.

     --nn      Print out the previously obtained statistics from the filesys-
             tems.  This option should be used if it is possible that one or
             more filesystems are in a state such that they will not be able
             to provide statistics without a long delay.  When this option is
             specified, ddff will not request new statistics from the filesys-
             tems, but will respond with the possibly stale statistics that
             were previously obtained.

     --tt      Only print out statistics for filesystems of the specified types.
             More than one type may be specified in a comma separated list.
             The list of filesystem types can be prefixed with ``no'' to spec-
             ify the filesystem types for which action should _n_o_t be taken.
             For example, the ddff command:

                   df -t nonfs,mfs

             lists all filesystems except those of type NFS and MFS. The
             sysctl(8) command can be used to find out the types of filesys-
             tems that are available on the system:

                   sysctl vfs

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environmental variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                counts will be displayed in units of that size block.

     The --nn and --tt flags are ignored if a file or filesystem is specified.
