     TTccooppyy is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made about
     the tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.  TTccooppyy with only a
     source tape (_r_m_t_0 by default) specified will print information about the
     sizes of records and tape files.  If a destination is specified a copy
     will be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the destination tape
     will be identical to that used on the source tape.  Copying a tape will
     yield the same output as if just printing the sizes.

     Options:

     --cc        Copy _s_r_c to _d_e_s_t and then verify that the two tapes are identi-
               cal.

     --ss _m_a_x_b_l_k
               Specify a maximum block size, _m_a_x_b_l_k.

     --vv        Given the two tapes, and _d_e_s_t verify that they are identical.

     --xx        Output all informational messages to the standard error.  This
               option is useful when _d_e_s_t is _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_o_u_t.
