     EExx is the root of a family of editors: eeddiitt, eexx and vvii. EExx is a superset
     of ed,  with the most notable extension being a display editing facility.
     Display based editing is the focus of vi(1) and requires a CRT.

     For users unfamiliar with ed(1),  the editor eeddiitt is probably easier to
     learn.  It avoids some of the complexities of eexx used mostly by systems
     programmers and persons comfortable with the ed(1) editor.

     The following documentation is found in the ``UNIX User's Manual
     Supplementary Documents'':

     _E_d_i_t_: _A _t_u_t_o_r_i_a_l provides a comprehensive introduction to eeddiitt assuming
     no previous knowledge of computers or the UNIX system.

     for the command mode features of eexx, but you cannot learn to use the edi-
     tor by reading it.  For an introduction to more advanced forms of editing
     using the command mode of eexx see the editing documents written by Brian
     Kernighan for the editor ed(1);  the material in the introductory and ad-
     vanced documents works also with eexx.

     vi(1) and provides reference material on vi(1).  In addition, the _V_i
     _Q_u_i_c_k _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e card summarizes the commands of vi(1) in a useful, func-
     tional way, and is useful with the introduction.

     EExx appeared in 3BSD.

     The uunnddoo command causes all marks to be lost on lines changed and then
     restored if the marked lines were changed.

     UUnnddoo never clears the buffer modified condition.

     The zz command prints a number of logical rather than physical lines.
     More than a screen full of output may result if long lines are present.

     File input/output errors don't print a name if the command line `--' op-
     tion is used.

     There is no easy way to do a single scan ignoring case.

     The editor does not warn if text is placed in named buffers and not used
     before exiting the editor.

     Null characters are discarded in input files, and cannot appear in resul-
     tant files.
