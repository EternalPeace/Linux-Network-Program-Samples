     The uunniiqq utility reads the standard input comparing adjacent lines, and
     writes a copy of each unique input line to the standard output.  The sec-
     ond and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not writ-
     ten.  Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not
     adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Precede each output line with the count of the number of times
             the line occurred in the input, followed by a single space.

     --dd      Don't output lines that are not repeated in the input.

     --ff _f_i_e_l_d_s
             Ignore the first _f_i_e_l_d_s in each input line when doing compar-
             isons.  A field is a string of non-blank characters separated
             from adjacent fields by blanks.  Field numbers are one based,
             i.e. the first field is field one.

     --ss _c_h_a_r_s
             Ignore the first _c_h_a_r_s characters in each input line when doing
             comparisons.  If specified in conjunction with the --ff option, the
             first _c_h_a_r_s characters after the first _f_i_e_l_d_s fields will be ig-
             nored.  Character numbers are one based, i.e. the first character
             is character one.

     --uu      Don't output lines that are repeated in the input.

     If additional arguments are specified on the command line, the first such
     argument is used as the name of an input file, the second is used as the
     name of an output file.

     The uunniiqq utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The historic ++_n_u_m_b_e_r and --_n_u_m_b_e_r options have been deprecated but are
     still supported in this implementation.

     The uunniiqq utility is expected to be IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'') compatible.
