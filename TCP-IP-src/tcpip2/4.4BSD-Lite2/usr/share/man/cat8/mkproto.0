     MMkkpprroottoo is used to bootstrap a new file system.  First a new file system
     is created using newfs(8).  MMkkpprroottoo is then used to copy files from the
     old file system into the new file system according to the directions
     found in the prototype file _p_r_o_t_o. The prototype file contains tokens
     separated by spaces or new lines.  The first tokens comprise the specifi-
     cation for the root directory.  File specifications consist of tokens
     giving the mode, the user-id, the group id, and the initial contents of
     the file.  The syntax of the contents field depends on the mode.

     The mode token for a file is a 6 character string.  The first character
     specifies the type of the file.  (The characters --bbccdd specify regular,
     block special, character special and directory files respectively.)  The
     second character of the type is either uu or `--' to specify set-user-id
     mode or not.  The third is gg or `--' for the set-group-id mode.  The rest
     of the mode is a three digit octal number giving the owner, group, and
     other read, write, execute permissions, see chmod(1).

     Two decimal number tokens come after the mode; they specify the user and
     group ID's of the owner of the file.

     If the file is a regular file, the next token is a pathname whence the
     contents and size are copied.

     If the file is a block or character special file, two decimal number to-
     kens follow which give the major and minor device numbers.

     If the file is a directory, mmkkpprroottoo makes the entries `.' and `..' and
     then reads a list of names and (recursively) file specifications for the
     entries in the directory.  The scan is terminated with the token $$.

     A sample prototype specification follows:

           d--777 3 1
           usr     d--777 3 1
                   sh      ---755 3 1 /bin/sh
                   ken     d--755 6 1
                           $
                   b0      b--644 3 1 0 0
                   c0      c--644 3 1 0 0
                   $
           $

     There should be some way to specify links.

     There should be some way to specify bad blocks.

     MMkkpprroottoo can only be run on virgin file systems.  It should be possible to
     copy files into existent file systems.
