     The rrbboooottdd utility services boot requests from Hewlett-Packard worksta-
     tions over a local area network.  All boot files must reside in the boot
     file directory; further, if a client supplies path information in its
     boot request, it will be silently stripped away before processing.  By
     default, rrbboooottdd only responds to requests from machines listed in its
     configuration file.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa          Respond to boot requests from any machine.  The configuration
                 file is ignored if this option is specified.

     --dd          Run rrbboooottdd in debug mode.  Packets sent and received are dis-
                 played to the terminal.

     --ii _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e
                 Service boot requests on specified interface.  If unspeci-
                 fied, rrbboooottdd searches the system interface list for the low-
                 est numbered, configured ``up'' interface (excluding loop-
                 back).  Ties are broken by choosing the earliest match.

     Specifying _c_o_n_f_i_g___f_i_l_e on the command line causes rrbboooottdd to use a differ-
     ent configuration file from the default.

     The configuration file is a text file where each line describes a partic-
     ular machine.  A line must start with a machine's Ethernet address fol-
     lowed by an optional list of boot file names.  An Ethernet address is
     specified in hexadecimal with each of its six octets separated by a
     colon.  The boot file names come from the boot file directory.  The eth-
     ernet address and boot file(s) must be separated by white-space and/or
     comma characters.  A pound sign causes the remainder of a line to be ig-
     nored.

     Here is a sample configuration file:

     #
     # ethernet addr     boot file(s)        comments
     #
     08:00:09:0:66:ad    SYSHPBSD            # snake (4.3BSD)
     08:00:09:0:59:5b                        # vandy (anything)
     8::9:1:C6:75        SYSHPBSD,SYSHPUX    # jaguar (either)

     RRbboooottdd logs status and error messages via syslog(3).  A startup message
     is always logged, and in the case of fatal errors (or deadly signals) a
     message is logged announcing the server's termination.  In general, a
     non-fatal error is handled by ignoring the event that caused it (e.g. an
     invalid Ethernet address in the config file causes that line to be inval-
     idated).

     The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the server
     process using the kill(1) command:

             SIGHUP   Drop all active connections and reconfigure.



             SIGUSR1  Turn on debugging, do nothing if already on.

             SIGUSR2  Turn off debugging, do nothing if already off.

     and respond to the same boot packets.
