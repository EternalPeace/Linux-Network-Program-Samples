     RRoouuttee is a utility used to manually manipulate the network routing ta-
     bles.  It normally is not needed, as a system routing table management
     daemon such as routed(8),  should tend to this task.

     The rroouuttee: utility supports a limited number of general options, but a
     rich command language, enabling the user to specify any arbitrary request
     that could be delivered via the programmatic interface discussed in
     route(4).

     --nn      Bypasses attempts to print host and network names symbolically
             when reporting actions.  (The process of translating between sym-
             bolic names and numerical equivalents can be quite time consum-
             ing, and may require correct operation of the network; thus it
             may be expedient to forgo this, especially when attempting to re-
             pair networking operations),

     --vv      (verbose) Print additional details.

     --qq      Suppress all output.

     The rroouuttee: utility provides six commands:

     aadddd         Add a route.
     fflluusshh       Remove all routes.
     ddeelleettee      Delete a specific route.
     cchhaannggee      Change aspects of a route (such as its gateway).
     ggeett         Lookup and display the route for a destination.
     mmoonniittoorr     Continuously report any changes to the routing information
                 base, routing lookup misses, or suspected network partition-
                 ings.

     The monitor command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] mmoonniittoorr

     The flush command has the syntax

           rroouuttee [--nn] fflluusshh [_f_a_m_i_l_y]

     If the fflluusshh command is specified, rroouuttee will ``flush'' the routing ta-
     bles of all gateway entries.  When the address family may is specified by
     any of the --oossii, --xxnnss, or --iinneett modifiers, only routes having destina-
     tions with addresses in the delineated family will be deleted.

     The other commands have the following syntax:

           rroouuttee [--nn] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [--nneett | --hhoosstt] _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _g_a_t_e_w_a_y

     where _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the destination host or network, _g_a_t_e_w_a_y is the
     next-hop intermediary via which packets should be routed.  Routes to a
     particular host may be distinguished from those to a network by inter-
     preting the Internet address specified as the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_. The
     optional modifiers --nneett and --hhoosstt force the destination to be interpreted
     as a network or a host, respectively.  Otherwise, if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n has
     a ``local address part'' of INADDR_ANY , or if the _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n is the
     symbolic name of a network, then the route is assumed to be to a network;
     otherwise, it is presumed to be a route to a host.

     For example, 128.32 is interpreted as --hhoosstt 128.0.0.32; 128.32.130 is in-
     terpreted as --hhoosstt 128.32.0.130; --nneett 128.32 is interpreted as
     128.32.0.0; and --nneett 128.32.130 is interpreted as 128.32.130.0.

     If the destination is directly reachable via an interface requiring no
     intermediary system to act as a gateway, the --iinntteerrffaaccee modifier should
     be specified; the gateway given is the address of this host on the common
     network, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.

     The optional modifiers --xxnnss, --oossii, and --lliinnkk specify that all subsequent
     addresses are in the XNS OSI address families, or are specified as link-
     level addresses, and the names must be numeric specifications rather than
     symbolic names.

     The optional --nneettmmaasskk qualifier is intended to achieve the effect of an
     OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option, or to manually add subnet
     routes with netmasks different from that of the implied network interface
     (as would otherwise be communicated using the OSPF or ISIS routing proto-
     cols).  One specifies an additional ensuing address parameter (to be in-
     terpreted as a network mask).  The implicit network mask generated in the
     AF_INET case can be overridden by making sure this option follows the
     destination parameter.

     Routes have associated flags which influence operation of the protocols
     when sending to destinations matched by the routes.  These flags may be
     set (or sometimes cleared) by indicating the following corresponding mod-
     ifiers:

     -cloning   RTF_CLONING    - generates a new route on use
     -xresolve  RTF_XRESOLVE   - emit mesg on use (for external lookup)
     -iface    ~RTF_GATEWAY    - destination is directly reachable
     -static    RTF_STATIC     - manually added route
     -nostatic ~RTF_STATIC     - pretend route added by kernel or daemon
     -reject    RTF_REJECT     - emit an ICMP unreachable when matched
     -blackhole RTF_BLACKHOLE  - silently discard pkts (during updates)
     -proto1    RTF_PROTO1     - set protocol specific routing flag #1
     -proto2    RTF_PROTO2     - set protocol specific routing flag #2
     -llinfo    RTF_LLINFO     - validly translates proto addr to link addr

     The optional modifiers --rrtttt, --rrttttvvaarr, --sseennddppiippee, --rreeccvvppiippee, --mmttuu,
     --hhooppccoouunntt, --eexxppiirree, and --sssstthhrreesshh provide initial values to quantities
     maintained in the routing entry by transport level protocols, such as TCP
     or TP4.  These may be individually locked by preceding each such modifier
     to be locked by the --lloocckk meta-modifier, or one can specify that all en-
     suing metrics may be locked by the --lloocckkrreesstt meta-modifier.

     In a cchhaannggee or aadddd command where the destination and gateway are not suf-
     ficient to specify the route (as in the ISO case where several interfaces
     may have the same address), the --iiffpp or --iiffaa modifiers may be used to de-
     termine the interface or interface address.

     All symbolic names specified for a _d_e_s_t_i_n_a_t_i_o_n or _g_a_t_e_w_a_y are looked up
     first as a host name using gethostbyname(3).  If this lookup fails, get-
     netbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.

     RRoouuttee uses a routing socket and the new message types RTM_ADD,
     RTM_DELETE, RTM_GET, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the super-user may
     modify the routing tables.

             The specified route is being added to the tables.  The values
             printed are from the routing table entry supplied in the ioctl(2)
             call.  If the gateway address used was not the primary address of
             the gateway (the first one returned by gethostbyname(3)),  the
             gateway address is printed numerically as well as symbolically.

             An attempt to add a route failed because the gateway listed was
             not on a directly-connected network.  The next-hop gateway must
             be given.

             A delete operation was attempted for an entry which wasn't pre-

             An add operation was attempted, but the system was low on re-

             try.
