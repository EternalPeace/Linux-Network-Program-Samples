     BBuuggffiilleerr is a program to automatically intercept, acknowledge, redis-
     tribute and store bug reports.  BBuuggffiilleerr is normally invoked by the mail
     delivery program with a line similar to the following in _/_e_t_c_/_a_l_i_a_s_e_s.

           bugs:   "|bugfiler"

     It should be noted that the login ``bugs'' must exist for the bugfiler to
     run.  Unless otherwise noted all paths used by bbuuggffiilleerr are relative to
     the home directory of this login.  BBuuggffiilleerr also expects all of its files
     and directories to be owned by ``bugs''.

     Available options.

     --aa      Do not send automatic mail acknowledgement to the bug report fil-
             er.  (The default is to send the acknowledgement with the file
             _~_b_u_g_s_/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_/_b_u_g_:_a_c_k appended).

     --rr      Do not redistribute.

     --vv _v_e_r_s_i_o_n
             Override the _v_e_r_s_i_o_n provided within the bug report itself.

     For the bug report to be correctly filed, it must contain a line in the
     following format:

           Index:   _f_o_l_d_e_r    _v_e_r_s_i_o_n

     The directories _~_b_u_g_s_/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n and _~_b_u_g_s_/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_/_f_o_l_d_e_r must exist before
     bbuuggffiilleerr attempts to store the bug report.  Bug reports will be stored in
     files named by the concatenation of _v_e_r_s_i_o_n, _f_o_l_d_e_r, and sequential num-
     bers, i.e. if _v_e_r_s_i_o_n is ``4.3 BSD'' and _f_o_l_d_e_r is ``ucb'' the first bug
     report will be placed in _~_b_u_g_s_/_4_._3_B_S_D_/_u_c_b_/_1. If _f_o_l_d_e_r contains more than
     one component only the first one will be used, e.g. if _f_o_l_d_e_r is
     ``bin/from.c'' or ``bin/adb/con.c'' it will be treated as if it were sim-
     ply ``bin''.

     If the --rr flag is not supplied, redistribution of the bug reports is done
     as specified in the file _~_b_u_g_s_/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_/_b_u_g_:_r_e_d_i_s_t. This file is in the
     format of the aliases(5) file, including comments and entries requiring
     multiple lines, with the single exception that the _f_o_l_d_e_r component of
     the ``Index:'' line replaces the name to alias.  The special folder
     ``all:'' receives a redistribution of all bug reports sent to this
     _v_e_r_s_i_o_n. For example, the _b_u_g_:_r_e_d_i_s_t file

           #       bigbug gets a copy of everything
           all:    bigbug
           #       ucb folder redistribution list
           ucb:    karels, kjd@coke.berkeley.edu
                   ra@beno.css.gov

     will send copies of all bug reports with ``ucb'' as the _f_o_l_d_e_r to bigbug,
     karels, kjd, and ra.

     Reports that cannot be filed, due to an invalid ``Index:'' line or some
     other error, are placed in the directory _~_b_u_g_s_/_e_r_r_o_r_s. The bbuuggffiilleerr main-
     tainer should correct these bug reports and then run bbuuggffiilleerr, with the
     corrected report as its standard input, as bug reports with errors are
     neither acknowledged or redistributed.  All reports that bbuuggffiilleerr handles
     are logged in _~_b_u_g_s_/_l_o_g_.

     Valid bugs are also logged in the file _~_b_u_g_s_/_v_e_r_s_i_o_n_/_s_u_m_m_a_r_y_. This file
     has an entry for each bug report for _v_e_r_s_i_o_n in the format:

           Filename        Date
                Subject:
                Index:
                Owner:     Bugs Bunny
                Status:    Received

     Filename is the concatenation of _v_e_r_s_i_o_n, _f_o_l_d_e_r, and a number as de-
     scribed above.  Date is the date as reported by the system clock, using
     ctime(3).  The Subject: and Index: lines are copies of the ``Subject:''
     and ``index:'' lines contained in the bug report.  The Owner and Status
     fields are intended to provide a rudimentary method of tracking the sta-
     tus of bug reports.

     The file _~_b_u_g_s_/_b_u_g_:_l_o_c_k is the focus of all locking for bbuuggffiilleerr. If you
     wish to manipulate any of the log or error files, rename or remove it and
     bbuuggffiilleerr will treat all bug reports that it receives as if they were in-
     correctly formatted, i.e. it will place them in the directory
     _~_b_u_g_s_/_e_r_r_o_r_s, for later recovery by the bbuuggffiilleerr maintainer.  Obviously,
     this file must be created when you first install bbuuggffiilleerr.

     All errors that occur before _~_b_u_g_s_/_l_o_g is found are logged into the sys-
     tem log file, using syslog(8).

BBUUGGSS
     Since mail can be forwarded in a number of different ways, bbuuggffiilleerr does
     not recognize forwarded mail and will acknowledge to the forwarder in-
     stead of the original sender unless there is a ``Reply-To'' field in the
     header.

     This version of bbuuggffiilleerr is not compatible with the version released with
     4.3BSD in that it doesn't complain to the sender about incorrectly for-
     matted bug reports.  Frankly, we got tired of the profanity, not to men-
     tion the extended conversations bbuuggffiilleerr was holding with vacation(1).

     The bbuuggffiilleerr command appeared in 4.2BSD.
