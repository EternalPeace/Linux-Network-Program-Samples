     TTffttppdd is a server which supports the Internet Trivial File Transfer Pro-
     tocol (RFC 783). The TFTP server operates at the port indicated in the
     `tftp' service description; see services(5).  The server is normally
     started by inetd(8).

     The use of tftp(1) does not require an account or password on the remote
     system.  Due to the lack of authentication information, ttffttppdd will allow
     only publicly readable files to be accessed.  Files containing the string
     ``/..../'' are not allowed.  Files may be written only if they already ex-
     ist and are publicly writable.  Note that this extends the concept of
     ``public'' to include all users on all hosts that can be reached through
     the network; this may not be appropriate on all systems, and its implica-
     tions should be considered before enabling tftp service.  The server
     should have the user ID with the lowest possible privilege.

     Access to files may be restricted by invoking ttffttppdd with a list of direc-
     tories by including up to 20 pathnames as server program arguments in
     _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_e_t_d_._c_o_n_f. In this case access is restricted to files whose names
     are prefixed by the one of the given directories.  The given directories
     are also treated as a search path for relative filename requests.

     The options are:

     --ll      Logs all requests using syslog(3).

     --nn      Suppresses negative acknowledgement of requests for nonexistent
             relative filenames.
