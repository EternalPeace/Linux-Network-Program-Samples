     QQuuoottaacchheecckk examines each filesystem, builds a table of current disk us-
     age, and compares this table against that recorded in the disk quota file
     for the filesystem.  If any inconsistencies are detected, both the quota
     file and the current system copy of the incorrect quotas are updated (the
     latter only occurs if an active filesystem is checked).  By default both
     user and group quotas are checked.

     Available options:

     --aa      If the --aa flag is supplied in place of any filesystem names,
             qquuoottaacchheecckk will check all the filesystems indicated in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b
             to be read-write with disk quotas.  By default only the types of
             quotas listed in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b are checked.

     --gg      Only group quotas listed in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b are to be checked.

     --uu      Only user quotas listed in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b are to be checked.

     --vv      qquuoottaacchheecckk reports discrepancies between the calculated and
             recorded disk quotas.

     Specifying both --gg and --uu is equivalent to the default.  Parallel passes
     are run on the filesystems required, using the pass numbers in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b
     in an identical fashion to fsck(8).

     Normally qquuoottaacchheecckk operates silently.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk expects each filesystem to be checked to have a quota files
     named _q_u_o_t_a_._u_s_e_r and _q_u_o_t_a_._g_r_o_u_p which are located at the root of the as-
     sociated file system.  These defaults may be overridden in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b. If
     a file is not present, qquuoottaacchheecckk will create it.

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk is normally run at boot time from the _/_e_t_c_/_r_c_._l_o_c_a_l file, see
     rc(8),  before enabling disk quotas with quotaon(8).

     QQuuoottaacchheecckk accesses the raw device in calculating the actual disk usage
     for each user.  Thus, the filesystems checked should be quiescent while
     qquuoottaacchheecckk is running.
