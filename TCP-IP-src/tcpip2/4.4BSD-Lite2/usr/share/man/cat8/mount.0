     The mmoouunntt command calls the mount(2) system call to prepare and graft a
     _s_p_e_c_i_a_l _d_e_v_i_c_e or the remote node (rhost:path) on to the file system tree
     at the point _n_o_d_e. If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appro-
     priate information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The system maintains a list of currently mounted file systems.  If no ar-
     guments are given to mmoouunntt,, this list is printed.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      All the filesystems described in fstab(5) are mounted.  Excep-
             tions are those marked as ``noauto'' or are excluded by the --tt
             flag (see below).

     --dd      Causes everything to be done except for the actual system call.
             This option is useful in conjunction with the --vv flag to deter-
             mine what the mmoouunntt command is trying to do.

     --ff      Forces the revocation of write access when trying to downgrade a
             filesystem mount status from read-write to read-only.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  The following options are available:

             async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
                     This is a _d_a_n_g_e_r_o_u_s flag to set, and should not be used
                     unless you are prepared to recreate the file system
                     should your system crash.

             force   The same as --ff; forces the revocation of write access
                     when trying to downgrade a filesystem mount status from
                     read-write to read-only.

             noauto  This filesystem should be skipped when mount is run with
                     the --aa flag.

             nodev   Do not interpret character or block special devices on
                     the file system.  This option is useful for a server that
                     has file systems containing special devices for architec-
                     tures other than its own.

             noexec  Do not allow execution of any binaries on the mounted
                     file system.  This option is useful for a server that has
                     file systems containing binaries for architectures other
                     than its own.

             nosuid  Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
                     bits to take effect.

             rdonly  The same as --rr; mount the file system read-only (even the
                     super-user may not write it).

             sync    All I/O to the file system should be done synchronously.


             update  The same as --uu; indicate that the status of an already
                     mounted file system should be changed.

             union   Causes the namespace at the mount point to appear as the
                     union of the mounted filesystem root and the existing di-
                     rectory.  Lookups will be done in the mounted filesystem
                     first.  If those operations fail due to a non-existent
                     file the underlying directory is then accessed.  All cre-
                     ates are done in the mounted filesystem.

             Any additional options specific to a filesystem type that is not
             one of the internally known types (see the --tt option) may be
             passed as a comma separated list; these options are distinguished
             by a leading ``-'' (dash).  Options that take a value are speci-
             fied using the syntax -option=value.  For example, the mount com-
             mand:

                   mount -t mfs -o nosuid,-N,-s=4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

             causes mmoouunntt to execute the equivalent of:

                   /sbin/mount_mfs -o nosuid -N -s 4000 /dev/dk0b /tmp

     --rr      The file system is to be mounted read-only.  Mount the file sys-
             tem read-only (even the super-user may not write it).  The same
             as the ``rdonly'' argument to the --oo option.

     --tt _u_f_s | _l_f_s | _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _t_y_p_e
             The argument following the --tt is used to indicate the file system
             type.  The type _u_f_s is the default.  The _-_t option can be used to
             indicate that the actions should only be taken on filesystems of
             the specified type.  More than one type may be specified in a
             comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be pre-
             fixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which ac-
             tion should _n_o_t be taken.  For example, the mmoouunntt command:

                   mount -a -t nonfs,mfs

             mounts all filesystems except those of type NFS and MFS.

             If the type is not one of the internally known types, mount will
             attempt to execute a program in _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___X_X_X where _X_X_X is re-
             placed by the type name.  For example, nfs filesystems are mount-
             ed by the program _/_s_b_i_n_/_m_o_u_n_t___n_f_s.

     --uu      The --uu flag indicates that the status of an already mounted file
             system should be changed.  Any of the options discussed above
             (the --oo option) may be changed; also a file system can be changed
             from read-only to read-write or vice versa.  An attempt to change
             from read-write to read-only will fail if any files on the
             filesystem are currently open for writing unless the --ff flag is
             also specified.  The set of options is determined by first ex-
             tracting the options for the file system from the fstab table,
             then applying any options specified by the --oo argument, and fi-
             nally applying the --rr or --ww option.

     --vv      Verbose mode.

     --ww      The file system object is to be read and write.

             The options specific to NFS filesystems are described in the
             mount_nfs(8) manual page.
