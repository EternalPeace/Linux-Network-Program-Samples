     The mmoouunntt__ccdd99666600 command attaches the ISO-9660 filesystem residing on the
     device _s_p_e_c_i_a_l to the global filesystem namespace at the location indi-
     cated by _n_o_d_e. This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot
     time.

     The options are as follows:

     --ee      Enable the use of extended attributes.

     --gg      Do not strip version numbers on files.  (By default, if there are
             files with different version numbers on the disk, only the last
             one will be listed.)  In either case, files may be opened without
             explicitly stating a version number.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible op-
             tions and their meanings.

     --rr      Do not use any Rockridge extensions included in the filesystem.

BBUUGGSS
     The cd9660 filesystem does not support the original "High Sierra"
     ("CDROM001") format.

     POSIX device node mapping is currently not supported.

     Version numbers are not stripped if Rockridge extensions are in use.  In
     this case, accessing files that don't have Rockridge names without ver-
     sion numbers gets the one with the lowest version number and not the one
     with the highest.

     There is no ECMA support.
