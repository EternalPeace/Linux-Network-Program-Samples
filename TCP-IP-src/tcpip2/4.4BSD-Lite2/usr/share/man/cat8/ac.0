     aacc - display connect time accounting

     If the file _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_w_t_m_p exists, a record of individual login and logout
     times are written to it by init(8) and login(8) respectively.  The pro-
     gram aacc examines these records and writes the accumulated connect time
     for all logins to the standard output.

     Options available:

     --dd      Display the connect times in 24 hour chunks.

     --pp      Display individual user totals.

     --ww _f_i_l_e
             Read raw connect time data from _f_i_l_e instead of the default file
             _/_v_a_r_/_l_o_g_/_w_t_m_p.

     _u_s_e_r_s _._._.
             Display totals for the given individuals only.

     If no arguments are given, aacc displays the total amount of login time for
     all active accounts on the system.

     The default _w_t_m_p file is an infinitely increasing file unless frequently
     truncated.  This is normally done by the daily daemon scripts scheduled
     by cron(8) which rename and rotate the _w_t_m_p files before truncating them
     (and keeping about a weeks worth on hand).  No login times are collected
     however, if the file does not exist.
