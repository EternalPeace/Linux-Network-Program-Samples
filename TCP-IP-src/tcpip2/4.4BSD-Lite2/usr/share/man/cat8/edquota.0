     EEddqquuoottaa is a quota editor.  By default, or if the --uu flag is specified,
     one or more users may be specified on the command line.  For each user a
     temporary file is created with an ASCII representation of the current
     disk quotas for that user.  The list of filesystems with user quotas is
     determined from _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b. An editor is invoked on the ASCII file.  The
     editor invoked is vi(1) unless the environment variable EDITOR specifies
     otherwise.

     The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota
     to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.  Setting a hard limit
     to one indicates that no allocations should be permitted.  Setting a soft
     limit to one with a hard limit of zero indicates that allocations should
     be permitted on only a temporary basis (see --tt below).  The current usage
     information in the file is for informational purposes; only the hard and
     soft limits can be changed.

     On leaving the editor, eeddqquuoottaa reads the temporary file and modifies the
     binary quota files to reflect the changes made.

     If the --pp flag is specified, eeddqquuoottaa will duplicate the quotas of the
     prototypical user specified for each user specified.  This is the normal
     mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.

     If the --gg flag is specified, eeddqquuoottaa is invoked to edit the quotas of one
     or more groups specified on the command line.  The --pp flag can be speci-
     fied in conjunction with the --gg flag to specify a prototypical group to
     be duplicated among the listed set of groups.

     Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period that
     may be specified per filesystem.  Once the grace period has expired, the
     soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.  The default grace period for a
     filesystem is specified in _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_u_f_s_/_u_f_s_/_q_u_o_t_a_._h. The --tt flag can
     be used to change the grace period.  By default, or when invoked with the
     --uu flag, the grace period is set for all the filesystems with user quotas
     specified in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b. When invoked with the --gg flag the grace period
     is set for all the filesystems with group quotas specified in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b.
     The grace period may be specified in days, hours, minutes, or seconds.
     Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the default grace period
     should be imposed.  Setting a grace period to one second indicates that
     no grace period should be granted.

     Only the super-user may edit quotas.
