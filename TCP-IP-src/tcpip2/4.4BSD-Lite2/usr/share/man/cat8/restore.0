DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The rreessttoorree command performs the inverse function of dump(8).  A full
     backup of a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental back-
     ups layered on top of it.  Single files and directory subtrees may be re-
     stored from full or partial backups.  RReessttoorree works across a network; to
     do this see the --ff flag described below.  Other arguments to the command
     are file or directory names specifying the files that are to be restored.
     Unless the --hh flag is specified (see below), the appearance of a directo-
     ry name refers to the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that di-
     rectory.

     Exactly one of the following flags is required:

     --ii      This mode allows interactive restoration of files from a dump.
             After reading in the directory information from the dump, rreessttoorree
             provides a shell like interface that allows the user to move
             around the directory tree selecting files to be extracted.  The
             available commands are given below; for those commands that re-
             quire an argument, the default is the current directory.

             aadddd [_a_r_g]   The current directory or specified argument is added
                         to the list of files to be extracted.  If a directory
                         is specified, then it and all its descendents are
                         added to the extraction list (unless the --hh flag is
                         specified on the command line).  Files that are on
                         the extraction list are prepended with a ``*'' when
                         they are listed by llss.

             ccdd _a_r_g      Change the current working directory to the specified
                         argument.

             ddeelleettee [_a_r_g]
                         The current directory or specified argument is delet-
                         ed from the list of files to be extracted.  If a di-
                         rectory is specified, then it and all its descendents
                         are deleted from the extraction list (unless the --hh
                         flag is specified on the command line).  The most ex-
                         pedient way to extract most of the files from a di-
                         rectory is to add the directory to the extraction
                         list and then delete those files that are not needed.

             eexxttrraacctt     All the files that are on the extraction list are ex-
                         tracted from the dump.  RReessttoorree will ask which volume
                         the user wishes to mount.  The fastest way to extract
                         a few files is to start with the last volume, and
                         work towards the first volume.

             hheellpp        List a summary of the available commands.

             llss [_a_r_g]    List the current or specified directory.  Entries
                         that are directories are appended with a ``/''.  En-
                         tries that have been marked for extraction are
                         prepended with a ``*''.  If the verbose flag is set
                         the inode number of each entry is also listed.

             ppwwdd         Print the full pathname of the current working direc-
                         tory.

             qquuiitt        Restore immediately exits, even if the extraction
                         list is not empty.

             sseettmmooddeess    All the directories that have been added to the ex-
                         traction list have their owner, modes, and times set;
                         nothing is extracted from the dump.  This is useful
                         for cleaning up after a restore has been prematurely
                         aborted.

             vveerrbboossee     The sense of the --vv flag is toggled.  When set, the
                         verbose flag causes the llss command to list the inode
                         numbers of all entries.  It also causes rreessttoorree to
                         print out information about each file as it is ex-
                         tracted.

     --RR      RReessttoorree requests a particular tape of a multi volume set on which
             to restart a full restore (see the --rr flag below).  This is use-
             ful if the restore has been interrupted.

     --rr      Restore (rebuild a file system).  The target file system should
             be made pristine with newfs(8),  mounted and the user cd'd  into
             the pristine file system before starting the restoration of the
             initial level 0 backup. If the level 0 restores successfully, the
             --rr flag may be used to restore any necessary incremental backups
             on top of the level 0.  The --rr flag precludes an interactive file
             extraction and can be detrimental to one's health if not used
             carefully (not to mention the disk). An example:

                   newfs /dev/rrp0g eagle
                   mount /dev/rp0g /mnt
                   cd /mnt

                   restore rf /dev/rst8

             Note that rreessttoorree leaves a file _r_e_s_t_o_r_e_s_y_m_t_a_b_l_e in the root di-
             rectory to pass information between incremental restore passes.
             This file should be removed when the last incremental has been
             restored.

             RReessttoorree, in conjunction with newfs(8) and dump(8),  may be used
             to modify file system parameters such as size or block size.

     --tt      The names of the specified files are listed if they occur on the
             backup.  If no file argument is given, then the root directory is
             listed, which results in the entire content of the backup being
             listed, unless the --hh flag has been specified.  Note that the --tt
             flag replaces the function of the old dumpdir(8) program.

     --xx      The named files are read from the given media.  If a named file
             matches a directory whose contents are on the backup and the --hh
             flag is not specified, the directory is recursively extracted.
             The owner, modification time, and mode are restored (if possi-
             ble).  If no file argument is given, then the root directory is
             extracted, which results in the entire content of the backup be-
             ing extracted, unless the --hh flag has been specified.



     The following additional options may be specified:

     --bb _b_l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e
             The number of kilobytes per dump record.  If the --bb option is not
             specified, rreessttoorree tries to determine the block size dynamically.

     --cc      Normally, rreessttoorree will try to determine dynamically whether the
             dump was made from an old (pre-4.4) or new format file sytem.
             The --cc flag disables this check, and only allows reading a dump
             in the old format.

     --ff _f_i_l_e
             Read the backup from _f_i_l_e; _f_i_l_e may be a special device file like
             _/_d_e_v_/_r_m_t_1_2 (a tape drive), _/_d_e_v_/_r_s_d_1_c (a disk drive), an ordinary
             file, or `--' (the standard input).  If the name of the file is of
             the form ``host:file'', or ``user@host:file'', rreessttoorree reads from
             the named file on the remote host using rmt(8).

     --hh      Extract the actual directory, rather than the files that it ref-
             erences.  This prevents hierarchical restoration of complete sub-
             trees from the dump.

     --mm      Extract by inode numbers rather than by file name.  This is use-
             ful if only a few files are being extracted, and one wants to
             avoid regenerating the complete pathname to the file.

     --ss _f_i_l_e_n_o
             Read from the specified _f_i_l_e_n_o on a multi-file tape.  File num-
             bering starts at 1.

     --vv      Normally rreessttoorree does its work silently.  The --vv (verbose) flag
             causes it to type the name of each file it treats preceded by its
             file type.

     --yy      Do not ask the user whether to abort the restore in the event of
             an error.  Always try to skip over the bad block(s) and continue.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     Complaints if it gets a read error.  If --yy has been specified, or the us-
     er responds `y', rreessttoorree will attempt to continue the restore.

     If a backup was made using more than one tape volume, rreessttoorree will notify
     the user when it is time to mount the next volume.  If the --xx or --ii flag
     has been specified, rreessttoorree will also ask which volume the user wishes to
     mount.  The fastest way to extract a few files is to start with the last
     volume, and work towards the first volume.

     There are numerous consistency checks that can be listed by rreessttoorree. Most
     checks are self-explanatory or can ``never happen''.  Common errors are
     given below.

     Converting to new file system format.
             A dump tape created from the old file system has been loaded.  It
             is automatically converted to the new file system format.

     <filename>: not found on tape
             The specified file name was listed in the tape directory, but was
             not found on the tape.  This is caused by tape read errors while
             looking for the file, and from using a dump tape created on an
             active file system.

     expected next file <inumber>, got <inumber>
             A file that was not listed in the directory showed up.  This can
             occur when using a dump created on an active file system.



     Incremental dump too low
             When doing incremental restore, a dump that was written before
             the previous incremental dump, or that has too low an incremental
             level has been loaded.

     Incremental dump too high
             When doing incremental restore, a dump that does not begin its
             coverage where the previous incremental dump left off, or that
             has too high an incremental level has been loaded.

     Tape read error while restoring <filename>
     Tape read error while skipping over inode <inumber>
     Tape read error while trying to resynchronize
             A tape (or other media) read error has occurred.  If a file name
             is specified, then its contents are probably partially wrong.  If
             an inode is being skipped or the tape is trying to resynchronize,
             then no extracted files have been corrupted, though files may not
             be found on the tape.

     resync restore, skipped <num> blocks
             After a dump read error, rreessttoorree may have to resynchronize it-
             self.  This message lists the number of blocks that were skipped
             over.

FFIILLEESS
     /dev/rmt?          the default tape drive
     /tmp/rstdir*       file containing directories on the tape.
     /tmp/rstmode*      owner, mode, and time stamps for directories.
     ./restoresymtable  information passed between incremental restores.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
     dump(8),  newfs(8),  mount(8),  mkfs(8),  rmt(8)

BBUUGGSS
     RReessttoorree can get confused when doing incremental restores from dumps that
     were made on active file systems.

     A level zero dump must be done after a full restore.  Because restore
     runs in user code, it has no control over inode allocation; thus a full
     dump must be done to get a new set of directories reflecting the new in-
     ode numbering, even though the contents of the files is unchanged.
