     Mountd is the server for NFS mount requests from other client machines.
     Mountd listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS
     server specification; see _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n,

     Options and operands available for mmoouunnttdd:

     --nn      The --nn option allows non-root mount requests to be served.  This
             should only be specified if there are clients such as PC's, that
             require it.

     --rr      The --rr option allows mount RPCs requests for regular files to be
             served.  Although this seems to violate the mount protocol speci-
             fication, some diskless workstations do mount requests for their
             swapfiles and expect them to be regular files.  Since a regular
             file cannot be specified in _/_e_t_c_/_e_x_p_o_r_t_s, the entire file system
             in which the swapfiles resides will have to be exported with the
             --aallllddiirrss flag.

     _e_x_p_o_r_t_s_f_i_l_e
             The _e_x_p_o_r_t_s_f_i_l_e argument specifies an alternate location for the
             exports file.

     When mountd is started, it loads the export host addresses and options
     into the kernel using the mount(2) system call.  After changing the ex-
     ports file, a hangup signal should be sent to the mountd daemon to get it
     to reload the export information.  After sending the SIGHUP (kill -s HUP
     `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`), check the syslog output to see if mountd
     logged any parsing errors in the exports file.
