     The qquuoott command displays the total count of blocks owned by a user for
     the filesystem _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m. If the filesystem option _f_i_l_e_s_y_s_t_e_m is not
     specified, the file systems listed in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b are used.  The following
     options are available:

     --cc      Display information on file size and block usage. The file sizes
             are listed in the first column, the second column contains a
             count of how many files of that size were found and the third
             column lists the cumulative block usage for the displayed size
             and all smaller files.

     --ff      For each user, the number of files (inodes) owned is displayed in
             addition to the block usage.

     --nn      A list sorted by block usage is displayed.  This is the result of
             qquuoott executing the following command:

                   ncheck filesystem | sort +0n | quot -n filesystem
