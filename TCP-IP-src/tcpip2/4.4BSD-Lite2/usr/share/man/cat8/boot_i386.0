     power-up or after crashes.  An automatic consistency check of the file
     systems will be performed, and unless this fails, the system will resume
     multi-user operations.

     CCoolldd ssttaarrttss.. The 386 PC AT clones attempt to boot the floppy disk drive A
     (otherwise known as drive 0) first, and failing that, attempt to boot the
     hard disk C (otherwise known as hard disk controller 1, drive 0).  The
     automatic boot will attempt to load _v_m_u_n_i_x from partition A of either the
     floppy or the hard disk.  This boot may be aborted by typing any charac-
     ter on the keyboard repeatedly (four or five times at least) during the
     operating system load phase, after which the bootstrap will prompt for
     the file that you wish to load instead.

     One exception to this is the `d' key, which will not abort the load but
     instead silently force the DEBUG boot flags.  The boot flags for an auto-
     boot are 0, and 3 for the successive boot after an aborted autoboot se-
     quence.  No other provison is made for setting boot flags (yet).  A spe-
     cific device or bootstrap file may be used; for example,

     The file specifications used for the boostrap when loaded with the
     ``askme'' flag (e.g. an aborted autoboot) are of the form:

           device unit partition:

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is the type of the device, assumed to be on the ISA bus, to
     be searched, _u_n_i_t is the unit number of the disk or tape, and _p_a_r_t_i_t_i_o_n
     is the disk partition or tape file number.  Normal line editing charac-
     ters can be used when typing the file specification.  The following list
     of supported devices may vary from installation to installation:

           wd   ST506, IDE, ESDI, RLL disks on a WD100[2367] or lookalike
                controller
           fd   5 1/4" or 3 1/2" High density floppies

     For example, to boot from a file system which starts at cylinder 0 of
     unit 0 of an IDE disk, type ``wd0a:vmunix'' to the boot prompt;
     ``fd0a:vmunix'' would specify a 3 1/2" floppy drive 0 .

     In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the paper _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g
     _a_n_d _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_n_g _4_._3 _B_S_D_-_R_e_n_o _U_N_I_X _o_n _t_h_e _A_T_/_3_8_6 can be used to boot from a
     distribution tape.

     The disklabel format used by this version of BSD is quite different from
     that of other architectures.
