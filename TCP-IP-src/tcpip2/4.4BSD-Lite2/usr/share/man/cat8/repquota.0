     RReeppqquuoottaa prints a summary of the disk usage and quotas for the specified
     file systems.

     Available options:

     --aa      Print the quotas of all the filesystems listed in _/_e_t_c_/_f_s_t_a_b.

     --gg      Print only group quotas (the default is to print both group and
             user quotas if they exist).

     --uu      Print only user quotas (the default is to print both group and
             user quotas if they exist).

     --vv      Print a header line before printing each filesystem quotas.

     For each user or group, the current number files and amount of space (in
     kilobytes) is printed, along with any quotas created with edquota(8).

     Only members of the operator group or the super-user may use this com-
     mand.
