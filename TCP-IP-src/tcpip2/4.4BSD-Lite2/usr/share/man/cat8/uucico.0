     UUuucciiccoo performs the actual work involved in transferring files between
     systems.  Uucp(1) and uux(1) merely queue requests for data transfer
     which uuuucciiccoo processes.

     The following options are available.

     --LL      Only call ``local'' sites. A site is considered local if the de-
             vice-type field in L.sys(5) is one of LOCAL, DIR or TCP.

     --RR      Reverse roles.  When used with the --rr_1 option, this tells the re-
             mote system to begin sending its jobs first, instead of waiting
             for the local machine to finish.

     --dd_s_p_o_o_l_d_i_r
             Use _s_p_o_o_l_d_i_r as the spool directory. The default is
             _/_v_a_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_u_u_c_p_.

     --gg_g_r_a_d_e
             Only send jobs of grade _g_r_a_d_e or higher this transfer.  The grade
             of a job is specified when the job is queued by uucp(1) or
             uux(1).

     --rr_r_o_l_e  _r_o_l_e is either 1 or 0; it indicates whether uuuucciiccoo is to start up
             in master or slave role, respectively. 1 is used when running
             uuuucciiccoo by hand or from cron(8).  0 is used when another system
             calls the local system.  Slave role is the default.

     --ss_s_y_s_t_e_m
             Call only system _s_y_s_t_e_m. If --ss is not specified, and --rr_1 is spec-
             ified, uuuucciiccoo will attempt to call all systems for which there is
             work.  If --ss is specified, a call will be made even if there is
             no work for that system. This is useful for polling.

     --tt_t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d
             Use _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d as the line turnaround time (in minutes) instead
             of the default 30.  If _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d is missing or 0, line
             turnaround will be disabled.  After uuuucciiccoo has been running in
             slave role for _t_u_r_n_a_r_o_u_n_d minutes, it will attempt to run in mas-
             ter role by negotiating with the remote machine.  In earlier ver-
             sions of uuuucciiccoo, a transfer of many large files in one direction
             would hold up mail going in the other direction.  With the
             turnaround code working, the message flow will be more bidirec-
             tional in the short term.  This option only works with newer
             uuuucciiccoo's and is ignored by older ones.

     --xx_d_e_b_u_g
             Turn on debugging at level _d_e_b_u_g. Level 5 is a good start when
             trying to find out why a call failed. Level 9 is very detailed.
             Level 99 is absurdly verbose.  If _r_o_l_e is 1 (master), output is
             written to the standard error _s_t_d_e_r_r. If _s_t_d_e_r_r is unavailable,
             output is written to _/_v_a_r_/_s_p_o_o_l_/_u_u_c_p_/_A_U_D_I_T_/_s_y_s_t_e_m. When _r_o_l_e is 0
             (slave), debugging output is always written to the AUDIT file.


     If uuuucciiccoo receives a SIGFPE (see kill(1)),  it will toggle the debugging
     on or off.

     UUuuccppdd is the server for supporting uucp connections over networks.  UUuuccppdd
     listens for service requests at the port indicated in the ``uucp'' ser-
     vice specification; see services(5).  The server provides login name and
     password authentication before starting up uuuucciiccoo for the rest of the
     transaction.

     UUuucciiccoo is commonly used either of two ways: as a daemon run periodically
     by cron(8) to call out to remote systems, and as a ``shell'' for remote
     systems who call in.  For calling out periodically, a typical line in
     crontab would be:

     0    *    *    *    *    /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1

     This will run uuuucciiccoo every hour in master role.  For each system that has
     transfer requests queued, uuuucciiccoo calls the system, logs in, and executes
     the transfers. The file L.sys(5) is consulted for information about how
     to log in, while L-devices(5) specifies available lines and modems for
     calling.

     For remote systems to dial in, an entry in the passwd(5) file must be
     created, with a login ``shell'' of uuuucciiccoo. For example:

     nuucp:Password:6:1::/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico

     The UID for UUCP remote logins is not critical, so long as it differs
     from the UUCP Administrative login.  The latter owns the UUCP files, and
     assigning this UID to a remote login would be an extreme security hazard.
