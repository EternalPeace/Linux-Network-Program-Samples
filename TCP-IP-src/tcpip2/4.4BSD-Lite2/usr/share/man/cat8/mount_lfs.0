     The mmoouunntt__llffss command attaches a log-structured file system _s_p_e_c_i_a_l de-
     vice on to the file system tree at the point _n_o_d_e. In addition, the
     lfs_cleanerd(8) utility is invoked to clean the file system periodically.

     This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.

     The options are as follows:

     --dd      Run lfs_cleanerd(8) in debug mode.

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible op-
             tions and their meanings.

     --nn      Don't start lfs_cleanerd(8) on the file system.

     --ss      Cause lfs_cleanerd(8) to read data in small chunks when cleaning
             the file system.
