     FFiinnggeerrdd is a simple protocol based on _R_F_C_1_1_9_6 that provides an interface
     to the Name and Finger programs at several network sites.  The program is
     supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the
     system at the moment or a particular person in depth.  There is no re-
     quired format and the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single
     ``command line''.

     FFiinnggeerrdd listens for TCP requests at port 79.  Once connected it reads a
     single command line terminated by a <CRLF> which is passed to finger(1).
     FFiinnggeerrdd closes its connections as soon as the output is finished.

     If the line is null (i.e. just a <CRLF> is sent) then finger returns a
     ``default'' report that lists all people logged into the system at that
     moment.

     If a user name is specified (e.g.  eric<CRLF>) then the response lists
     more extended information for only that particular user, whether logged
     in or not.  Allowable ``names'' in the command line include both ``login
     names'' and ``user names''. If a name is ambiguous, all possible deriva-
     tions are returned.

     The following options may be passed to ffiinnggeerrdd as server program argu-
     ments in _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_e_t_d_._c_o_n_f:

     --ss      Enable secure mode.  Queries without a user name are rejected and
             forwarding of queries to other remote hosts is denied.

     --ll      Enable logging.  The name of the host originating the query is
             reported via syslog(3) at LOG_NOTICE priority.

     --pp      Use an alternate program as the local information provider.  The
             default local program executed by ffiinnggeerrdd is finger(1).  By spec-
             ifying a customized local server, this option allows a system
             manager to have more control over what information is provided to
             remote sites.

BBUUGGSS
     Connecting directly to the server from a TIP or an equally narrow-minded
     TELNET-protocol user program can result in meaningless attempts at option
     negotiation being sent to the server, which will foul up the command line
     interpretation.  FFiinnggeerrdd should be taught to filter out IAC's and perhaps
     even respond negatively (IAC WON'T) to all option commands received.

     The ffiinnggeerrdd command appeared in 4.3BSD.
