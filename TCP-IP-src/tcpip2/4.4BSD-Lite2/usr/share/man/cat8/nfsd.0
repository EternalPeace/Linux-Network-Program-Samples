     NNffssdd runs on a server machine to service NFS requests from client ma-
     chines.  At least one nnffssdd must be running for a machine to operate as a
     server.

     Unless otherwise specified, four servers for UDP transport are started.

     The following options are available:

     --rr      Register the NFS service with portmap(8) without creating any
             servers.  This option can be used along with the --uu or --tt options
             to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.

     --nn      Specifies how many servers to create.

     --tt      Serve TCP NFS clients.

     --uu      Serve UDP NFS clients.

     For example, ``nfsd -u -t 6'' serves UDP and TCP transports using six
     daemons.

     A server should run enough daemons to handle the maximum level of concur-
     rency from its clients, typically four to six.

     NNffssdd listens for service requests at the port indicated in the NFS server
     specification; see _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _F_i_l_e _S_y_s_t_e_m _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, RFC1094

     The nnffssdd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The nnffssdd utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
