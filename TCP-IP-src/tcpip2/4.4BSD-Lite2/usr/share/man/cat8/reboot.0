     The hhaalltt and rreebboooott utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send
     all running processes a SIGTERM (and subsequently a SIGKILL) and, respec-
     tively, halt or restart the system.  The action is logged, including en-
     tering a shutdown record into the login accounting file.

     The options are as follows:

     --nn      If the --nn option is specified, the file system cache is not
             flushed.  This option should probably not be used.

     --qq      If the --qq option is specified, the system is halted or restarted
             quickly and ungracefully, and only the flushing of the file sys-
             tem cache is performed.  This option should probably not be used.

     Normally, the shutdown(8) utility is used when the system needs to be
     halted or restarted, giving users advance warning of their impending
     doom.
