     The uummoouunntt command calls the unmount(2) system call to remove a _s_p_e_c_i_a_l
     _d_e_v_i_c_e or the remote node (rhost:path) from the filesystem tree at the
     point _n_o_d_e. If either _s_p_e_c_i_a_l or _n_o_d_e are not provided, the appropriate
     information is taken from the fstab(5) file.

     The options are as follows:

     --aa      All the filesystems described in fstab(5) are unmounted.

     --AA      All the currently mounted filesystems except the root are un-
             mounted.

     --ff      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
             continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
             accesses are attempted.  The root filesystem cannot be forcibly
             unmounted.

     --hh _h_o_s_t
             Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be unmount-
             ed.  This option is implies the --AA option and, unless otherwise
             specified with the --tt option, will only unmount NFS filesystems.

     --tt _t_y_p_e
             Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-
             tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified
             in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
             prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which
             action should _n_o_t be taken.  For example, the uummoouunntt command:

                   umount -a -t nfs,mfs

             umounts all filesystems of the type NFS and MFS.

     --vv      Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem
             is unmounted.
