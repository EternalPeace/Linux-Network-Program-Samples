     power-up or after crashes.  An automatic consistency check of the file
     systems will be performed as described in fsck(8).  and unless this
     fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.

     CCoolldd ssttaarrttss The SPARC system currently uses the SunOS bootstrap loaders.
     This will be changed in a future version of the system.  The SunOS boot
     will attempt to load _v_m_u_n_i_x from partition A of the boot device, which
     must currently be an ``sd'' disk.

     The [--ss] flag to the SunOS boot loader will being the system up in sin-
     gle-user mode.  The [--dd] flag to the SunOS boot loader will bring the
     system up in debug mode.  Here it waits for a kernel debugger connect;
     see kgdb(8).  Other flags are currently ignored.

     The use of Sun disk labels, without the ability to write them, is prob-
     lematic.
