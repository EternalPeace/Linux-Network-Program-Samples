       format - how to format disk packs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       There  are two ways to format disk packs.  The simplest is
       to use the _f_o_r_m_a_t program.  The alternative is to use  the
       DEC  standard formatting software which operates under the
       DEC diagnostic supervisor.  This manual page describes the
       operation  of  _f_o_r_m_a_t,  then  concludes  with some remarks
       about using the DEC formatter.

       _F_o_r_m_a_t is a standalone program used to  format  and  check
       disks  prior to constructing file systems.  In addition to
       the formatting operation, _f_o_r_m_a_t records any  bad  sectors
       encountered  according to DEC standard 144.  Formatting is
       performed one track at a time by writing  the  appropriate
       headers and a test pattern and then checking the sector by
       reading and verifying the pattern, using the  controller's
       ECC  for  error  detection.   A sector is marked bad if an
       unrecoverable media error is detected, or if a correctable
       ECC error too many bits in length is detected (such errors
       are indicated as ``ECC'' in the summary printed upon  com-
       pleting  the format operation).  After the entire disk has
       been formatted and checked, the total number of errors are
       reported, any bad sectors and skip sectors are marked, and
       a bad sector forwarding table is written to  the  disk  in
       the  first  five  even numbered sectors of the last track.
       It is also possible to reformat sections of  the  disk  in
       units  of  tracks.   _F_o_r_m_a_t  may  be used on any UNIBUS or
       MASSBUS drive supported by the _u_p and  _h_p  device  drivers
       which uses 4-byte headers (everything except RP's).

       The  test  pattern  used  during  the  media  check may be
       selected from one of: 0xf00f (RH750  worst  case),  0xec6d
       (media  worst case), and 0xa5a5 (alternating 1's and 0's).
       Normally the media worst case pattern is used.

       _F_o_r_m_a_t also has an option to perform an  extended  "severe
       burn-in,"  which  makes a number of passes using different
       patterns.  The number of passes can  be  selected  at  run
       time, up to a maximum of 48, with provision for additional
       passes or termination  after  the  preselected  number  of
       passes.   This  test runs for many hours, depending on the
       disk and processor.

       Each time _f_o_r_m_a_t is run to format an entire disk,  a  com-
       pletely  new bad sector table is generated based on errors
       encountered while formatting.  The device driver, however,
       will  always attempt to read any existing bad sector table
       when the device is first opened.  Thus, if a disk pack has
       never  previously  been  formatted,  or has been formatted

       with different sectoring,  five  error  messages  will  be
       printed  when  the  driver attempts to read the bad sector
       table; these diagnostics should be ignored.

       Formatting a 400 megabyte disk  on  a  MASSBUS  disk  con-
       troller  usually  takes about 20 minutes.  Formatting on a
       UNIBUS disk controller takes  significantly  longer.   For
       every hundredth cylinder formatted _f_o_r_m_a_t prints a message
       indicating the current cylinder  being  formatted.   (This
       message  is  just  to  reassure  people that nothing is is
       amiss.)

       _F_o_r_m_a_t uses the standard notation of  the  standalone  I/O
       library  in  identifying a drive to be formatted.  A drive
       is specified as _z_z(_x,_y), where _z_z refers to the controller
       type (either _h_p or _u_p), _x is the unit number of the drive;
       8 times the UNIBUS or  MASSBUS  adaptor  number  plus  the
       MASSBUS drive number or UNIBUS drive unit number; and _y is
       the file system partition on drive _x (this  should  always
       be 0).  For example, ``hp(1,0)'' indicates that drive 1 on
       MASSBUS adaptor 0 should be formatted; while  ``up(10,0)''
       indicates  that  UNIBUS drive 2 on UNIBUS adaptor 1 should
       be formatted.

       Before each formatting attempt, _f_o_r_m_a_t prompts the user in
       case debugging should be enabled in the appropriate device
       driver.  A carriage return disables debugging information.

       _F_o_r_m_a_t should be used prior to building file systems (with
       _n_e_w_f_s(8)) to insure that all  sectors  with  uncorrectable
       media  errors  are  remapped.   If a drive develops uncor-
       rectable defects after  formatting,  either  _b_a_d_1_4_4(8)  or
       _b_a_d_s_e_c_t(8) should be able to avoid the bad sectors.

       A  sample  run  of _f_o_r_m_a_t is shown below.  In this example
       (using a VAX-11/780), _f_o_r_m_a_t is loaded  from  the  console
       floppy;  on  an 11/750 _f_o_r_m_a_t will be loaded from the root
       file system with _b_o_o_t(8) following a "B/3" command.  Bold-
       face  means  user input.  As usual, ``#'' and ``@'' may be
       used to edit input.

       You should shut down UNIX and halt the machine to  do  any
       disk  formatting.   Make  certain  you put in the pack you
       want formatted.  It is also a good idea to  spin  down  or
       write  protect the disks you don't want to format, just in
       case.
