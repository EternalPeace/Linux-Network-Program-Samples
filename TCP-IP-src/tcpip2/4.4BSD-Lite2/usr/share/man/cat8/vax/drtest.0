     ddrrtteesstt - standalone disk test program

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDrrtteesstt is a standalone program used to read a disk track by track.  It
     was primarily intended as a test program for new standalone drivers, but
     has shown useful in other contexts as well, such as verifying disks and
     running speed tests. For example, when a disk has been formatted (by
     format(8)),  you can check that hard errors has been taken care of by
     running ddrrtteesstt. No hard errors should be found, but in many cases quite a
     few soft ECC errors will be reported.

     While ddrrtteesstt is running, the cylinder number is printed on the console
     for every 10th cylinder read.

     A sample run of drtest is shown below.  In this example (using a 750),
     ddrrtteesstt is loaded from the root file system; usually it will be loaded
     from the machine's console storage device.  Boldface means user input.
     As usual, ``#'' and ``@'' may be used to edit input.

     The diagnostics are intended to be self explanatory. Note, however, that
     the device number in the diagnostic messages is identified as _t_y_p_e_X in-
     stead of _t_y_p_e_(_a_,_u_) where _X = a*8+u, e.g., hp(1,3) becomes hp11.
