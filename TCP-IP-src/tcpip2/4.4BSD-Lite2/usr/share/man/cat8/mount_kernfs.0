     The mmoouunntt__kkeerrnn command attaches an instance of the kernel parameter
     namespace to the global filesystem namespace.  The conventional mount
     point is _/_k_e_r_n. This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot
     time.

     The filesystem includes several regular files which can be read, some of
     which can also be written.  The contents of the files is in a machine-
     independent format, either a string, or an integer in decimal ASCII.
     Where numbers are returned, a trailing newline character is also added.

     The options are as follows:

     --oo      Options are specified with a --oo flag followed by a comma separat-
             ed string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for possible op-
             tions and their meanings.

FFIILLEESS
     boottime   the time at which the system was last booted (decimal ASCII).
     copyright  kernel copyright message.
     hostname   the hostname, with a trailing newline.  The hostname can be
                changed by writing to this file.  A trailing newline will be
                stripped from the hostname being written.
     hz         the frequency of the system clock (decimal ASCII).
     loadavg    the 1, 5 and 15 minute load average in kernel fixed-point for-
                mat.  The final integer is the fix-point scaling factor.  All
                numbers are in decimal ASCII.
     pagesize   the machine pagesize (decimal ASCII).
     physmem    the number of pages of physical memory in the machine (decimal
                ASCII).
     root       the system root directory.  In a chroot'ed environment,
                mmoouunntt__kkeerrnnffss can be used to create a new _/_k_e_r_n mount point.
                _/_k_e_r_n_/_r_o_o_t will then refer to the system global root, not the
                current process root.
     rootdev    the root device.
     rrootdev   the raw root device.
     time       the second and microsecond value of the system clock.  Both
                numbers are in decimal ASCII.
     version    the kernel version string.  The head line for _/_e_t_c_/_m_o_t_d can be
                generated by running: ``sseedd 11qq //kkeerrnn//vveerrssiioonn''

     The mmoouunntt__kkeerrnnffss utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
