     The llffss__cclleeaanneerrdd command starts a daemon process which garbage-collects
     the log-structured file system residing at the point named by _n_o_d_e in the
     global file system namespace.  This command is normally executed by
     mount_lfs(8) when the log-structured file system is mounted.  The daemon
     will exit within a few minutes of when the file system it was cleaning is
     unmounted.

     Garbage collection on a log-structured file system is done by scanning
     the file system's segments for active, i.e. referenced, data and copying
     it to new segments.  When all of the active data in a given segment has
     been copied to a new segment that segment can be marked as empty, thus
     reclaiming the space taken by the inactive data which was in it.

     The following options are available:

     --dd      Run in debug mode.  Do not become a daemon process, and print de-
             bugging information.

     --ss      When cleaning the file system, read data in small chunks.
