     UUuussnnaapp displays in tabular format a synopsis of the current UUCP situa-
     tion.  The format of each line is as follows:

           site   N Cmds   N Data   N Xqts   Message

     Where "site" is the name of the site with work, "N" is a count of each of
     the three possible types of work (command, data, or remote execute), and
     "Message" is the current status message for that site as found in the
     STST file.

     Included in "Message" may be the time left before UUCP can re-try the
     call, and the count of the number of times that UUCP has tried (unsuc-
     cessfully) to reach the site.
