     power-up or after crashes.  An automatic consistency check of the file
     systems will be performed, and unless this fails, the system will resume
     multi-user operations.

     CCoolldd ssttaarrttss.. On an HP300, the boot procedure uses the boot ROM to load a
     boot program from an LIF format directory at the beginning of an attached
     disk.  The _/_u_s_r_/_m_d_e_c directory contains a disk boot programs which should
     be placed in a new pack automatically by newfs(8) when the ``a'' parti-
     tion file system on the pack is created.

     This _b_o_o_t program finds the corresponding file on the given device
     (_v_m_u_n_i_x by default), loads that file into memory, and starts the program
     at the entry address specified in the program header.

     The boot program can be interrupted by typing `^C' (ctrl-C).  This will
     force the boot program to interactively prompt for a system to boot.  If
     not interrupted, it will boot from the device from which the boot program
     itself was loaded.

     The file specifications used for an interactive boot are of the form:

           device(unit, minor)

     where _d_e_v_i_c_e is the type of the device to be searched, _u_n_i_t is 8 * the
     hpib number plus the unit number of the disk or tape, and _m_i_n_o_r is the
     disk partition or tape file number.  Normal line editing characters can
     be used when typing the file specification.  Currently, ``rd'' and ``sd''
     are the only valid _d_e_v_i_c_e specifiers.

     For example, to boot from the `a' file system of unit 0 on HP-IB 2, type
     `rd(16, 0)vmunix' to the boot prompt.  For tapes, the minor device number
     gives a file offset.

     In an emergency, the bootstrap methods described in the paper _I_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g
     _4_._3_b_s_d _o_n _t_h_e _H_P_3_0_0 can be used to boot from a distribution tape.
