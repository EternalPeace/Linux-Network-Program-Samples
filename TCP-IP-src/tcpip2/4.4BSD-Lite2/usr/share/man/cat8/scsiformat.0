     The ssccssiiffoorrmmaatt utility can be used to format SCSI disks on systems that
     support on-line SCSI formatting (currently this is limited to the HP300
     and SPARC ports).  It will also show the various parameters set in the
     SCSI controller.

     The options are as follows:

     --pp      Modify how the SCSI mode sense page query is constructed.  By de-
             fault, ssccssiiffoorrmmaatt asks for the current settings.  The page-
             control flag is one of:

             c    gets current settings.
             d    gets default settings (those provided by the disk's manufac-
                  turer).
             s    gets saved settings (those that persist across power cy-
                  cles).
             v    shows which parameters are variable.

     --rr      Don't format, instead display the disk parameters.

     These should mostly be self-explanatory.  A copy of the SCSI standard (or
     a more readable derivative) may be useful, however.
