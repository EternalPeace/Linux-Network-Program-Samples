     KKvvmm__mmkkddbb creates a database in _/_v_a_r_/_d_b containing information about the
     specified file.  If no file is specified, _/_v_m_u_n_i_x is used by default.
     The file is named ``kvm_filename.db'', where ``filename'' is the name of
     the file read.  Various library routines consult this database.  The only
     information currently stored is the kernel namelist, which is used by the
     kvm_nlist(3) function, however, in the future the database may contain
     other static information about the current system.
