     AAmmdd is a daemon that automatically mounts filesystems whenever a file or
     directory within that filesystem is accessed.  Filesystems are automati-
     cally unmounted when they appear to be quiescent.

     AAmmdd operates by attaching itself as an NFS server to each of the speci-
     fied _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s. Lookups within the specified directories are handled by
     aammdd, which uses the map defined by _m_a_p_n_a_m_e to determine how to resolve
     the lookup.  Generally, this will be a host name, some filesystem infor-
     mation and some mount options for the given filesystem.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --aa _t_e_m_p_o_r_a_r_y_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
             Specify an alternative location for the real mount points.  The
             default is _/_a.

     --cc _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n
             Specify a _d_u_r_a_t_i_o_n, in seconds, that a looked up name remains
             cached when not in use.  The default is 5 minutes.

     --dd _d_o_m_a_i_n
             Specify the local domain name.  If this option is not given the
             domain name is determined from the hostname.

     --kk _k_e_r_n_e_l_-_a_r_c_h
             Specifies the kernel architecture.  This is used solely to set
             the ${karch} selector.

     --ll _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
             Specify a logfile in which to record mount and unmount events.
             If _l_o_g_f_i_l_e is the string _s_y_s_l_o_g, the log messages will be sent to
             the system log daemon by syslog(3).

     --nn      Normalize hostnames.  The name referred to by ${rhost} is normal-
             ized relative to the host database before being used.  The effect
             is to translate aliases into ``official'' names.

     --pp      Print _P_I_D. Outputs the process-id of aammdd to standard output where
             it can be saved into a file.

     --rr      Restart existing mounts.  AAmmdd will scan the mount file table to
             determine which filesystems are currently mounted.  Whenever one
             of these would have been auto-mounted, aammdd _i_n_h_e_r_i_t_s it.

     --tt _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l_._i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
             Specify the _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l, in tenths of a second, between NFS/RPC/UDP
             retries.  The default is 0.8 seconds.  The second values alters
             the retransmit counter.  Useful defaults are supplied if either
             or both values are missing.

     --vv      Version.  Displays version and configuration information on stan-




             dard error.

     --ww _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
             Specify an _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l, in seconds, between attempts to dismount
             filesystems that have exceeded their cached times.  The default
             is 2 minutes.

     --yy _d_o_m_a_i_n
             Specify an alternative NIS domain from which to fetch the NIS
             maps.  The default is the system domain name.  This option is ig-
             nored if NIS support is not available.

     --xx _o_p_t_i_o_n_s
             Specify run-time logging options.  The options are a comma sepa-
             rated list chosen from: fatal, error, user, warn, info, map,
             stats, all.

     --DD _o_p_t_i_o_n
             Select from a variety of debug options.  Prefixing an option with
             the string _n_o reverses the effect of that option.  Options are
             cumulative.  The most useful option is _a_l_l.

     Since --DD is only used for debugging other options are not documented
     here: the current supported set of options is listed by the --vv option and
     a fuller description is available in the program source.

     Some care may be required when creating a mount map.

     Symbolic links on an NFS filesystem can be incredibly inefficient.  In
     most implementations of NFS, their interpolations are not cached by the
     kernel and each time a symbolic link is encountered during a _l_o_o_k_u_p_p_n
     translation it costs an RPC call to the NFS server.  A large improvement
     in real-time performance could be gained by adding a cache somewhere.
     Replacing symlinks(2) with a suitable incarnation of the auto-mounter re-
     sults in a large real-time speedup, but also causes a large number of
     process context switches.

     A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the fea-
     tures.
