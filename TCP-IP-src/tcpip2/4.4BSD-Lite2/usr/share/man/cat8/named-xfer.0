       _N_a_m_e_d_-_x_f_e_r is an ancillary program executed by _n_a_m_e_d(8) to
       perform an inbound zone transfer.  It is  rarely  executed
       directly, and only by system administrators who are trying
       to debug a zone transfer problem.  See RFC's  1033,  1034,
       and  1035 for more information on the Internet name-domain
       system.

       Options are:

       --zz     specifies the name of the zone to be transferred.

       --ff     specifies the name of the file into which the  zone
              should  be dumped when it is received from the pri-
              mary server.

       --ss     specifies the serial number of our current copy  of
              this  zone.   If the SOA RR we get from the primary
              server does not have a serial  number  higher  than
              this, the transfer will be aborted.

       --dd     Print  debugging  information.   A number after the
              ``d'' determines the level of messages printed.

       --ll     Specifies a log file for debugging  messages.   The
              default  is  system-  dependent  but  is usually in
              _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p or _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p.  Note that this only  applies
              if _-_d is also specified.

       --tt     Specifies  a trace file which will contain a proto-
              col trace of the zone transfer.  This  is  probably
              only  of  interest  to  people  debugging  the name
              server itself.

       --pp     Use a different port number.  The  default  is  the
              standard  port  number  as  returned  by getservby-
              name(3) for service ``domain''.

       --SS     Perform a restricted transfer of only the  SOA,  NS
              records  and  glue  A records for the zone. The SOA
              record will not be loaded by named but will be used
              to  determine  when  to verify the NS records.  the

       Additional arguments are taken as name server addresses in
       so-called ``dotted-quad'' syntax only; no  host  name  are
       allowed  here.   At  least  one address must be specified.
       Any additional addresses will be tried  in  order  if  the
       first one fails to transfer to us successfully.
