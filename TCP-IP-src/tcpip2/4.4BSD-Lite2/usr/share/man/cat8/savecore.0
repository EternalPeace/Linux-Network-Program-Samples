     SSaavveeccoorree copies the currently running kernel and its associated core dump
     into _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, and enters a reboot message and information about the
     core dump into the system log.

     The options are as follows:

     --cc         Clears the dump, so that future invocations of ssaavveeccoorree will
                ignore it.

     --ff         Forces a dump to be taken even if the dump doesn't appear cor-
                rect or there is insufficient disk space.

     --NN         Use _s_y_s_t_e_m as the kernel instead of the default ``/vmunix''.

     --vv         Prints out some additional debugging information.

     --zz         Compresses the core dump and kernel (see compress(1)).

     SSaavveeccoorree checks the core dump in various ways to make sure that it is
     current and that it corresponds to the currently running system.  If it
     passes these checks, it saves the core image in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_/_v_m_c_o_r_e_._# and
     the system in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_/_v_m_u_n_i_x_._# The ``#'' is the number from the first
     line of the file _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_/_b_o_u_n_d_s, and it is incremented and stored back
     into the file each time ssaavveeccoorree successfully runs.

     SSaavveeccoorree also checks the available disk space before attempting to make
     the copies.  If there is insufficient disk space in the filesystem con-
     taining _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, or if the file _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_/_m_i_n_f_r_e_e exists and the number
     of free kilobytes (for non-superusers) in the filesystem after the copies
     were made would be less than the number in the first line of this file,
     the copies are not attempted.

     If ssaavveeccoorree successfully copies the kernel and the core dump, the core
     dump is cleared so that future invocations of ssaavveeccoorree will ignore it.

     SSaavveeccoorree is meant to be called near the end of the initialization file
     _/_e_t_c_/_r_c (see rc(8)).
