     The ccoonnffssttrr() function provides a method for applications to get configu-
     ration defined string values.

     The _n_a_m_e argument specifies the system variable to be queried.  Symbolic
     constants for each name value are found in the include file <unistd.h>.
     The _l_e_n argument specifies the size of the buffer referenced by the argu-
     ment _b_u_f. If _l_e_n is non-zero, _b_u_f is a non-null pointer, and _n_a_m_e has a
     value, up to _l_e_n - 1 bytes of the value are copied into the buffer _b_u_f.
     The copied value is always null terminated.

     The available values are as follows:

     _CS_PATH
             Return a value for the PATH environment variable that finds all
             the standard utilities.

     If the call to ccoonnffssttrr is not successful, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set
     appropriately.  Otherwise, if the variable does not have a configuration
     defined value, 0 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is not modified.  Otherwise, the
     buffer size needed to hold the entire configuration-defined value is re-
     turned.  If this size is greater than the argument _l_e_n, the string in _b_u_f
     was truncated.

EERRRROORRSS
     The ccoonnffssttrr function may fail and set _e_r_r_o_r for any of the errors speci-
     fied for the library functions malloc(3) and sysctl(3).

     In addition, the following errors may be reported:

     [EINVAL]      The value of the _n_a_m_e argument is invalid.

     The ccoonnffssttrr function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
