     An executable program compiled using the --ppgg option to cc(1) automatical-
     ly includes calls to collect statistics for the gprof(1) call-graph exe-
     cution profiler.  In typical operation, profiling begins at program
     startup and ends when the program calls exit.  When the program exits,
     the profiling data are written to the file _g_m_o_n_._o_u_t, then gprof(1) can be
     used to examine the results.

     mmoonnccoonnttrrooll() selectively controls profiling within a program.  When the
     program starts, profiling begins.  To stop the collection of histogram
     ticks and call counts use mmoonnccoonnttrrooll(_0); to resume the collection of his-
     togram ticks and call counts use mmoonnccoonnttrrooll(_1).  This feature allows the
     cost of particular operations to be measured.  Note that an output file
     will be produced on program exit regardless of the state of mmoonnccoonnttrrooll().

     Programs that are not loaded with --ppgg may selectively collect profiling
     statistics by calling mmoonnssttaarrttuupp() with the range of addresses to be pro-
     filed.  _l_o_w_p_c and _h_i_g_h_p_c specify the address range that is to be sampled;
     the lowest address sampled is that of _l_o_w_p_c and the highest is just below
     _h_i_g_h_p_c. Only functions in that range that have been compiled with the --ppgg
     option to cc(1) will appear in the call graph part of the output; howev-
     er, all functions in that address range will have their execution time
     measured.  Profiling begins on return from mmoonnssttaarrttuupp().
