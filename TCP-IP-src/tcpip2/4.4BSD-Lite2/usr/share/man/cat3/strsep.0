     The ssttrrsseepp() function locates, in the string referenced by _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p, the
     first occurrence of any character in the string _d_e_l_i_m (or the terminating
     `\0' character) and replaces it with a `\0'. The location of the next
     character after the delimiter character (or NULL, if the end of the
     string was reached) is stored in _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p. The original value of _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p
     is returned.

     An ``empty'' field, i.e. one caused by two adjacent delimiter characters,
     can be detected by comparing the location referenced by the pointer re-
     turned in _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p to `\0'.

     If _*_s_t_r_i_n_g_p is initially NULL, ssttrrsseepp() returns NULL.

     The following uses ssttrrsseepp() to parse a string, containing tokens delimit-
     ed by white space, into an argument vector:

           char **ap, *argv[10], *inputstring;

           for (ap = argv; (*ap = strsep(&inputstring, " \t")) != NULL;)
                   if (**ap != '\0')
                           ++ap;

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The ssttrrsseepp() function is intended as a replacement for the ssttrrttookk() func-
     tion.  While the ssttrrttookk() function should be preferred for portability
     reasons (it conforms to ANSI C X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C '')) it is unable to
     handle empty fields, i.e. detect fields delimited by two adjacent delim-
     iter characters, or to be used for more than a single string at a time.
     The ssttrrsseepp() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

4.4BSD                           June 9, 1993                                1
