/*
 * ATAN2(Y,X)
 * RETURN ARG (X+iY)
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 *
 * Scaled down version to weed out special cases.  "Normal" cases are
 * handled by calling atan2__A(), an assembly coded support routine in
 * support.s.
 *
 * Required system supported functions :
 *	copysign(x,y)
 *	atan2__A(y,x)
 *	
 * Method :
 *	1. Deal with special cases
 *	2. Call atan2__A() to do the others
 *
 * Special cases:
 * Notations: atan2(y,x) == ARG (x+iy) == ARG(x,y).
 *
 *	ARG( NAN , (anything) ) is NaN;
 *	ARG( (anything), NaN ) is NaN;
 *	ARG(+(anything but NaN), +-0) is +-0  ;
 *	ARG(-(anything but NaN), +-0) is +-PI ;
 *	ARG( 0, +-(anything but 0 and NaN) ) is +-PI/2;
 *	ARG( +INF,+-(anything but INF and NaN) ) is +-0 ;
 *	ARG( -INF,+-(anything but INF and NaN) ) is +-PI;
 *	ARG( +INF,+-INF ) is +-PI/4 ;
 *	ARG( -INF,+-INF ) is +-3PI/4;
 *	ARG( (anything but,0,NaN, and INF),+-INF ) is +-PI/2;
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	atan2(y,x) returns (PI/pi) * the exact ARG (x+iy) nearly rounded, 
 *	where
 *
 *	in decimal:
 *		pi = 3.141592653589793 23846264338327 ..... 
 *    53 bits   PI = 3.141592653589793 115997963 ..... ,
 *    56 bits   PI = 3.141592653589793 227020265 ..... ,  
 *
 *	in hexadecimal:
 *		pi = 3.243F6A8885A308D313198A2E....
 *    53 bits   PI = 3.243F6A8885A30  =  2 * 1.921FB54442D18	error=.276ulps
 *    56 bits   PI = 3.243F6A8885A308 =  4 * .C90FDAA22168C2    error=.206ulps
 *	
 *	In a test run with 356,000 random argument on [-1,1] * [-1,1] on a
 *	VAX, the maximum observed error was 1.41 ulps (units of the last place)
 *	compared with (PI/pi)*(the exact ARG(x+iy)).
 *
 * Note:
 *	We use machine PI (the true pi rounded) in place of the actual
 *	value of pi for all the trig and inverse trig functions. In general, 
 *	if trig is one of sin, cos, tan, then computed trig(y) returns the 
 *	exact trig(y*pi/PI) nearly rounded; correspondingly, computed arctrig 
 *	returns the exact arctrig(y)*PI/pi nearly rounded. These guarantee the 
 *	trig functions have period PI, and trig(arctrig(x)) returns x for
 *	all critical values x.
 *	
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
