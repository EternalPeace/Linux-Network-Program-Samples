.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm uusnap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Uusnap
displays in tabular format a synopsis of the current

situation.  The format of each line is as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact

site   N Cmds   N Data   N Xqts   Message

.Ed
Where "site" is the name of the site with work, "N" is a count of
each of the three possible types of work (command, data, or remote execute),
and "Message" is the current status message for that
site as found in the
.Tn STST
file.
.Pp
Included in "Message" may be the time left before
.Tn UUCP
can re-try the
call, and the count of the number of times that
.Tn UUCP
has tried
(unsuccessfully) to reach the site.
