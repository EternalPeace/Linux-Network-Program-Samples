Yup, the bug exists in Ultrix 2.2 as well.  I have reported this bug to
DEC support every time we get a new release.  I assume that my bug reports
are getting filed (in the circular file).

It is clear that whoever made this "fix" at DEC had no understanding
of curses whatsoever.  As in the earlier posting, the bug can be fixed
by replacing the definitions of the nl() and nonl() macros in curses.h with:

#define nl()	 (_tty.sg_flags |= CRMOD,_pfast = _rawmode,stty(_tty_ch, &_tty))
#define nonl()	 (_tty.sg_flags &= ~CRMOD, _pfast = TRUE, stty(_tty_ch, &_tty))

- john nelson.

P.S.  I did reach someone at DEC who would listen (Thanks Chet!)  My
      understanding is that they have no plans to fix this bug, as curses
      is now "owned" by some group in England, who is working on a port of the
      terminfo curses for Ultrix 2.4.  I'm just pissed that my bug reports
      submitted for Ultrix 1.2 and 2.0 were ignored.
