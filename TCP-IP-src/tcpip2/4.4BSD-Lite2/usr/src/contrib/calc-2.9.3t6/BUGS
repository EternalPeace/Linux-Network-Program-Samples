The following are the known bugs and mis-features in 2.9.3.  

    * Saber C warns about several problems related to accessing memory
      that has not been previously set.  Purify, on the other hand,
      does not issue such warnings.  These problems need to be looked
      into and if they are real, they need to be fixed.

      One may not need Saber C to work on this problem.  The warning
      spots have been marked as comments in the source.  To find these
      warnings, grep for the XXX symbol in the source.

    * Purify reports that calc leaks memory.  Plug these leaks or
      determine that such leaks are non-issues.
    
    * Calc does not support negative mods.

    * The output of list(2,3,4) is indented differently from list().
