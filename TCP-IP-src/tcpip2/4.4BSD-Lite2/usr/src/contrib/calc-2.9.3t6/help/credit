	Thanks for suggestions and encouragement from Peter Miller,
	Neil Justusson, and Landon Noll.

	Thanks to Stephen Rothwell for writing the original version of
	hist.c which is used to do the command line editing.

	Thanks to Ernest W. Bowen for supplying some improvements in
	accuracy and generality for some numeric functions.  Much of
	this was in terms of actual code which I gratefully accepted.

	Portions of this program are derived from an earlier set of
	public domain arbitrarily precision routines which was posted
	to the net around 1984.  By now, there is almost no recognizable 
	code left from that original source.
