Notes for BSD build:

The exisiting Makefile is a simple makefile that will build libg++ without
much problems.

Makefile.GNU is the original gnu Makefile.

It is *highly* advisable that you use the bsd Makefile since it is simpler and
doesn't have all the (unexpected) side effects that the gnu Makefile causes.
