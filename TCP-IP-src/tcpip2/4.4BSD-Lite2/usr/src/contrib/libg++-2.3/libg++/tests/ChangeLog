Sun Nov  1 14:44:13 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tInteger.cc (modtest):  New function, from a bug report.
	* tInteger.exp: New output.

Fri Oct 16 15:33:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Remove some obsolete junk.

Fri Sep 25 11:32:47 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tiLList.cc:  New files (derived from tList.cc) to
	check template-based versions of SLList and DLList.
	* Makefile.in:  Use tiLList.cc.

Mon Aug 10 15:11:42 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (make-tests):  New rule to build all the
	tests without running them (useful when ross-compiling.)
	* tSet.cc (main):  Rename argc <-> argv.
	* tSet.exp, tBag.exp, tMap.exp:  Update to handle new hashing
	policy for <int>VH{Set,Bag,Map} classes.

Mon Jul 20 15:45:29 1992  Mike Stump  (mrs@cygnus.com)

	* tObstack.cc (main):  Add cast from void * to char since it is
	not a standard conversion.

Fri Jun 26 11:46:53 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tRational.cc:  Use the slightly more standard M_PI
	instead of plain PI.

Wed Jun 17 16:50:45 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Fix *clean rules.  Add $(LDFLAGS) when linking.
	Remove the '-' error suppressing prefix so that failing
	checks cause the make to fail.
	Clean out the remnants of the obsolete runtests rule.
	* out.iostream, out.old-stream:  Removed - no longer used.
	* test_h.cc:  Don't #include <bstring.h> - it is non-standard.

Thu May 14 15:08:37 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* test_h.cc: Only #include sys/socket.h and sys/resource.h
	if these are available (according to _G_config.h).

Fri May  8 15:41:12 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Pass $(NOSTDINC) to compiler.

Thu May  7 00:48:11 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tList.cc (randseq):  Evaluate 1st parameter of recursive
	call to randeq() first (separately).  (Unspecified order of
	parameter evaluation was why the sun3 and sun4 versions
	gave different results.)

Wed May  6 01:10:58 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* tList.cc:  For randseq(), use a dumb but portable
	"random" number generator.  (For unknown reason, the
	old code gave different result on sun3 and sun4.)
	* tList.exp:  New output.
	* Makefile.in:  Don't run 'check-tRandom' as part of
	'check', because it isn't portable (byte-order problems?).

	* iostream.out:  Split into multiple files, moving the
	tFile output into tFile.exp, etc.
	* Makefile.in:  Add lots of new rules for check-tFile,
	check-tObstack etc.  THese run an individual test,
	and compare the output to the matching *.exp file.
	This makes it easier to track down problems, and
	adds flexibility by making it easier to add or remove tests.
	* test_h.cc:  Don't include bool.h, which is deprecated
	because it is likely to conflict with other header files.

Fri Apr 17 14:48:26 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tPQ.cc: Update delete of array to modern syntax.
	* test_h.cc:  #include _G_config.h.
	Only #include <sys/resource.h> if not SYSV.

Tue Mar 10 18:16:28 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tests_h.cc:  Include sys/time.h before sys/resource.h,
	according to traditional requirement.

Fri Mar  6 15:11:36 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* tests_h.cc:  Don't include malloc.h, since it is
	not a standard include file.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Fri Jan 31 17:07:30 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Add $(LSRCS) (the generated source files)
	to DEPEND_SOURCES.  (Otherwise, make fails to generate
	some of the i*.h include files.)

	* Makefile.in: Add i{CH,Splay}Node.{cc,h,o} (because
	CHNode and SplayNode have been moved into their own
	include files).
	* out.iostream: Change to match real output (now that
	all discrepancies from old output are explained).

Sat Jan 25 00:32:45 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Replace libtest.a by LIBTEST macro.
	* out.iostream:  "Fix".
	* tFile.cc: New iostream class and classes derived from
	it allow us to support much more of the fucntionality
	of the old library.

Thu Jan 16 18:00:04 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* expected.out, out_iostream, out.old_stream, Makefile.in:
	Replace expected.out by two versions:  One when using new
	iostreams, and one for old streams.
	* Makefile.in:  Some tweaks to 'make depend.'
	* tFix16.cc, tFix24.cc:  Replace check macro by overloaded
	inline functions.   This forces side effects (including
	error messages) when evaluating the operands to happen
	before printing.
	* tFile.cc:  Comditionally compile depending on
	_OLD_STREAMS macro (defined by stream.h) so that most
	tests work for both new iostreams as well as old streams.
	* test_h.cc:  Remove obsolete include files.

Sun Jan  5 00:03:06 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in:  Add 'make depend' support.
	* tBag.cc, tMap.cc, tPQ.cc, tSet.cc:  #include <builtin.h>,
	because new iostream library doesn't automatically include it.
	* tFile.cc, test_h.cc:  #ifdef out code that won't work with new
	iostream library.  Other tweaks for new library.
