editbuf: A String Buffer Package

The editbuf package is a set of C++ classes for manipulating
string buffers. A buffer is variable size, and is
implemented using the buffer-gap method used by Emacs;
it is therefore suitable for fairly heavy-duty operations.
You can create sub-strings of buffers (or sub-strings);
these are first-class values.

edit_streambuf
-------------

An edit_streambuf is a streambuf using an edit_string as its source/sink,
similar to a strstreambuf (but more powerful).

edit_streambuf::edit_streambuf(edit_string* str, int mode);

Construct a new edit_streambuf.
The mode can be the usual ios::open_mode bits.
Interpretation:
	ios::in - Open for reading.
	ios::out - Open for writing. If no other bits are
	given, the string will be truncated when the streambuf
	is closed: Everything between the current position
	and the end of STR will then be deleted. This means
	that the STR will be replaced by new data; however,
	any existing marks into STR will still be meaningful
	(instead of all being moved down to either end of STR).
	ios::app - Actually open the empty string at
	the end of STR. (NOT IMPLEMENTED).
	ios::ate - Do a seek to the end immediately.
	ios::trunc - Truncate string initially (at open).
