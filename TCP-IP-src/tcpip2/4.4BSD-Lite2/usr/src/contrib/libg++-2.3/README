		   README for GNU development tools
			    Cygnus Support

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file
gdb/README.  If with a gas release, see gas/README, etc.

It is now possible to configure and build a variety of tools with one
command.  To build all of the tools contained herein, run the
``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure MYHOSTTYPE

followed by running ``make''.  (MYHOSTTYPE is a name for your host computer,
for instance "sun4".  You can use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether
a name is recognized; if it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet 
specifying CPU, vendor, and OS.)

See etc/cfg-paper.texi, etc/configure.texi, and/or the README files in
various subdirectories, for more details.
