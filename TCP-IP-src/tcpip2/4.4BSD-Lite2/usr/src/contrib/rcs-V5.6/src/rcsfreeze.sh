# rcsfreeze - assign a symbolic revision number to a configuration of RCS files

#	$Id: rcsfreeze.sh,v 4.4 1991/04/21 11:58:24 eggert Exp $

#       The idea is to run rcsfreeze each time a new version is checked
#       in. A unique symbolic revision number (C_[number], where number
#       is increased each time rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to the most
#       recent revision of each RCS file of the main trunk.
#
#       If the command is invoked with an argument, then this
#       argument is used as the symbolic name to freeze a configuration.
#       The unique identifier is still generated
#       and is listed in the log file but it will not appear as
#       part of the symbolic revision name in the actual RCS file.
#
#       A log message is requested from the user which is saved for future
#       references.
#
#       The shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.
#       It is important that all changed files are checked in (there are
#       no precautions against any error in this respect).
#       file names:
#       {RCS/}.rcsfreeze.ver	version number
#       {RCS/}.rscfreeze.log	log messages, most recent first
