Mon Jun 15 01:35:55 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* readline.c: Make new SIGNALS_* macros to parameterize the 
	ugly changes in signal blocking.  Use them throughout,
	reducing #ifdef HAVE_POSIX_SIGNALS and HAVE_BSD_SIGNALS clutter
	significantly.  Make all such places use POSIX if available,

	* readline.c (readline_default_bindings):  Only make use of VLNEXT
	when both VLNEXT and TERMIOS_TTY_DRIVER is defined.  On SVR4
	<termio.h> includes <termios.h>, so VLNEXT is always defined.

	* sysdep-norm.h (_POSIX_VERSION):  Define this for all SVR4

	* Makefile.in, config/hm-sysv, config/hm-sco:  Change SYSV to
	USG to match current usage.

	the other.  New defines used HAVE_POSIX_SIGNALS, and
	TERMIOS_TTY_DRIVER.

Tue Jul 30 22:37:26 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_getc () If a call to read () returns without an
	error, but with zero characters, the file is empty, so return EOF.

Thu Jul 11 20:58:38 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: (rl_get_next_history, rl_get_previous_history)
	Reallocate the buffer space if the line being moved to is longer
	the the current space allocated.  Amazing that no one has found
	this bug until now.

	* readline.c: Rework parsing conditionals to pay attention to the

	work correctly.

Mon Jun 24 20:45:59 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: support for displaying key binding information
	includes the functions rl_list_funmap_names (),

	rl_dump_functions (), and rl_function_dumper ().

	funmap.c: support for same includes rl_funmap_names ().

	readline.c, funmap.c: no longer define STATIC_MALLOC.  However,
	update both version of xrealloc () to handle a null pointer.

Thu Apr 25 12:03:49 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* vi_mode.c (rl_vi_fword, fWord, etc.  All functions use
	the macro `isident()'.  Fixed movement bug which prevents
	continious movement through the text.

Fri Jul 27 16:47:01 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c (parser_if) Allow "$if term=foo" construct.

Wed May 23 16:10:33 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	executed.  Fixed typo in username_completion_function ().

Mon Apr  9 19:55:48 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: username_completion_function (); For text passed in
	with a leading `~', remember that this could be a filename (after
	it is completed).

Thu Apr  5 13:44:24 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_search_history (): Correctly handle case of an
	unfound search string, but a graceful exit (as with ESC).

	* readline.c: rl_restart_output ();  The Apollo passes the address
	of the file descriptor to TIOCSTART, not the descriptor itself.

Tue Mar 20 05:38:55 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* readline.c: rl_complete (); second call in a row causes possible
	completions to be listed.

	* readline.c: rl_redisplay (), added prompt_this_line variable
	which is the first character character following \n in prompt.

Sun Mar 11 04:32:03 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* Signals are now supposedly handled inside of SYSV compilation.

Wed Jan 17 19:24:09 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* history.c: history_expand (); fixed overwriting memory error,
	added needed argument to call to get_history_event ().

Thu Jan 11 10:54:04 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* readline.c: added mark_modified_lines to control the
	display of an asterisk on modified history lines.  Also
	added a user variable called mark-modified-lines to the
	`set' command.

Thu Jan  4 10:38:05 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	capability.

Fri Sep  8 09:00:45 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: rl_prep_terminal ().  Only turn on 8th bit
	  as meta-bit iff the terminal is not using parity.

Sun Sep  3 08:57:40 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: start_insert ().  Uses multiple
	  insertion call in cases where that makes sense.

	  rl_insert ().  Read type-ahead buffer for additional
	  keys that are bound to rl_insert, and insert them
	  all at once.  Make insertion of single keys given
	  with an argument much more efficient.

Tue Aug  8 18:13:57 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: Changed handling of EOF.  readline () returns
	 (char *)EOF or consed string.  The EOF character is read from the
	 tty, or if the tty doesn't have one, defaults to C-d.

	* readline.c: Added support for event driven programs.
	  rl_event_hook is the address of a function you want called
	  while Readline is waiting for input.

	* readline.c: Cleanup time.  Functions without type declarations
	  do not use return with a value.

	* history.c: history_expand () has new variable which is the
	  characters to ignore immediately following history_expansion_char.

Sun Jul 16 08:14:00 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	  of reading the line.

Tue Jul 11 06:25:01 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* readline.c: new variable rl_tilde_expander.
	  If non-null, this contains the address of a function to call if
	  the standard meaning for expanding a tilde fails.  The function is
	  called with the text sans tilde (as in "foo"), and returns a
	  malloc()'ed string which is the expansion, or a NULL pointer if
	  there is no expansion. 

	* readline.h - new file chardefs.h
	  Separates things that only readline.c needs from the standard
	  header file publishing interesting things about readline.

	* readline.c:
	  readline_default_bindings () now looks at terminal chararacters
	  and binds those as well.

Wed Jun 28 20:20:51 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at aurel)

	* Made readline and history into independent libraries.
