The files in this directory are shared with Intel Corporation's NINDY

family processor, and talks to GDB over a serial line.

Do not change these files without coordinating with Intel Corporation
at 5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway, Hillsboro, OR 97124.  The GNU960 tools
group are the right people to talk to.  Maybe postmaster@ichips.intel.com
can direct you to the current maintainers.
