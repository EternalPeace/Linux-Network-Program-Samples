		   README for GNU development tools
			    Cygnus Support

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file
gdb/README.  If with a gas release, see gas/README, etc.

It is now possible to configure and build a variety of tools with one
command.  To build any or all of the tools contained herein, run the
``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure myhosttype

followed by running ``make''.  To see all the possible tools that can
be configured here, do:

	./configure -v myhosttype

See cfg-paper.texi, configure.texi, and/or the README files in various
subdirectories, for more details.
