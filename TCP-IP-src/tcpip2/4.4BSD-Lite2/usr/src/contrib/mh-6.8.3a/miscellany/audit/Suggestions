    That is, that the Received: lines might be useful.  For the person who
    wanted to avoid infinite loops, the problem could be solved by your
    package if you enabled the individual Received: lines to be parsed.
    He could, for example do:

	rcvdist("myself@siteB") if ( ! grep (/siteB/, @received));

    (If there is no Received: line for siteB, he would forward it to siteB,
    thus preventing infinite loops).  The mirror system would be on siteB for
    siteA.

    (Actually, I could do the same thing!  I have the same (or a similar)
    problem).
