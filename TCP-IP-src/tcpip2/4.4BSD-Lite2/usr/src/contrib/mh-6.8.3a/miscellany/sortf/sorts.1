\fISortf\fR sorts the specified messages in the named
folder according to the alphabetical order of the
\*(lqFrom:\*(rq field or the \*(lqTo:\*(rq field of each
message, depending on whether the message is incoming or
outgoing, repectively.

\fISorts\fR sorts the specified messages in the named
folder according to the alphabetical order of the
\*(lqSubject:\*(rq of each message.

The messages are remapped onto the same set of message
numbers that they originally occupied, so if you only have
messages numbered 27, 38, and 192 in the selected folder
before the sort, that's what you'll have afterwards too.
Thus messages which are in the folder, but not specified by
`msgs', are left in place, and if a message does not exist
(the folder has a gap), \fIsortf\fR and \fIsortf\fR will
not fill the gap.

The `\-verbose' switch directs \fIsortf\fR and \fIsorts\fR
to tell the user the general actions that they are taking
to place the folder in sorted order.

The `\-nofold' switch makes the sort case-sensitive.

If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.
If the current message is moved, \fIsortf\fR and
\fIsorts\fR will not preserve its status as current.
.Bu
\fIsortf\fR and \fIsorts\fR are rather slow, especially if
you really do receive 200 mail messages a day.

\fIsortf\fR and \fIsorts\fR create a temporary folder named
MaIlSoRt\fInnnn\fR, where \fInnnn\fR is a numeral, under
the folder in which you're sorting.  If a file with this
name already exists, \fIsortf\fR or \fIsorts\fR will fail.

Interrupt handling is really terrible (nonexistent).
If an interrupt is encountered, such as a BREAK or a system crash,
some or all of the messages will be left
in the temporary subfolder.

\fIsortf\fR's and \fIsorts\fR's behaviors are inconsistent
with \fIsortm\fR's when sorting a folder with gaps between
the messages or when sorting a noncontiguous set of
messages.
