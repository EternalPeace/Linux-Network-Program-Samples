# Options required by SunOS 3.5.  (You can use FLOCK instead of LOCKF
# if you don't have multiple machine mounting mail spools with NFS.)
#
mts	sendmail/smtp
options	BIND BSD42 DBMPWD LOCKF
curses	-lcurses -ltermcap
sprintf	int

#
# Site preference options.
#
# Note that if you choose not to use the option "BERK" and you use Domain
# Name Service via NIS, then you'd better add "ldoptlibs -lresolv" to
# prevent post(1) from hanging on hosts with MX records and no address
# records.  (No, you really don't want to know why.)
#
# Also, under SunOS 3.5 you'll need to add "ccoptions -I../h -I../../h
# -I../../../h" because the supplied libresolv.a under SunOS 3.5 uses the
# newer BSD4.3 based hostent structure which is different from the BSD4.2
# based hostent structure declared in /usr/include/netdb.h.  Why does adding
# this help?  There's a version of netdb.h in ../h that has the BSD4.3 based
# hostent structure.  We need to use all the different forms of ../h because
# the MH makefile system doesn't offer a $(TOP) variable like the X Windows
# Makefile system ...  (sigh) I told you that you didn't want to know about
# any of this ...
