# sys5r4-ncr	- an NCR system: Unix System V Release 4.0.2.0 (WINS)
# running MMDF2 with SMTP posting
#
# Apparently, there are two compilation environments: 4.2BSD and SYS5.
# This config file uses the SYS5 environment -- I never could get the
# 4.2BSD environment directory routines to work right.
#
# You may want to define SVR4; this option was added after MH was
# ported to the NCR, and I haven't been able to test it there.
#
# uip/vmh.c still won't compile because of loader problems with the
# curses & termlib libraries.  Also, NCR should fix their loader not to try
# to search additional libraries for modules that have already been found.
