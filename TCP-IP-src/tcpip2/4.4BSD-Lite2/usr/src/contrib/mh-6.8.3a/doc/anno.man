       _A_n_n_o annotates the specified messages in the named  folder
       using  the  field and body.  Annotation is optionally per-
       formed by _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l, to keep track of your dis-
       tribution of, forwarding of, and replies to a message.  By
       using _a_n_n_o, you can perform arbitrary annotations of  your
       own.   Each  message  selected  will be annotated with the
       lines

           field: date
           field: body

       The `-nodate' switch inhibits the date annotation, leaving
       only  the  body  annotation.  The `-inplace' switch causes
       annotation to be done in place in order to preserve  links
       to the annotated message.

       The  field  specified  should be a valid 822-style message
       field name, which means that it should consist of alphanu-
       merics  (or dashes) only.  The body specified is arbitrary
       text.

       If a `-component field' is  not  specified  when  _a_n_n_o  is
       invoked,  _a_n_n_o  will prompt the user for the name of field
       for the annotation.
