       What follows is a description of the responsibilities of a
       BBleader.  This is a working collection  of  facts:  there
       are  no  simple  or elegant rules.  In the discussion that
       follows, substitute in the name of  your  BBoard  wherever
       you see the ficticious name ``hacks''.

            When  you  are appointed a BBleader by the person who
            is acting as the _P_o_s_t_M_a_s_t_e_r  you  should  first  make
            sure  that  the  four  addresses associated with your
            BBoard are correct (see _b_b_o_a_r_d_s (1)).  To check this,
            try  "bbc  -topics  -verbose  hacks".   You should be
            listed  under  local  leader(s),   and   the   BBoard
            addresses should be correct.

            There  are  three  functions  that you should perform
            periodically:
              RReeaadd tthhee BBBBooaarrdd : If you're  a  BBoard  leader  you
                   should be keeping up on what's going on.
              RReemmoovvee  iinnaapppprroopprriiaattee  mmaatteerriiaall :  If offsensive or
                   otherwise non-sensical material shows  up,  or
                   if  a  duplicate  message appears, use the _B_B_l
                   program, delete the  offending  messages  from
                   the folder.
              AArrcchhiivvee  nnoonn--rreecceenntt mmaatteerriiaall : The archive facility
                   has been upgraded to  be  almost  fully  auto-
                   mated.  BBoards with the Auto-Archive flag set
                   will have old material automatically placed in
                   the  archive  area  once a week.  You may also
                   archive material yourself if you like,  or  if
                   your  BBoard is not set to Auto-Archive.  Just
                   file messages in the folder ``+bbl'' into  the
                   folder  ``+bbl/arc''  You should archive mate-
                   rial whenever it takes a long time to read  in
                   a  BBoard  using _b_b_c and _m_s_h.  The only excep-
                   tion to this is (possibly) the aapp--nneewwss and nnyy--
                   ttiimmeess  BBoards, in which case non-recent mate-
                   rial is usually deleted, and an archive is not
                   kept.

            As  a  BBoard leader there are three groups of people
            that you will be required to deal with:

              BBBBooaarrdd uusseerrss : Correspondence from BBoard users  is
                   usually   addressed   to  llooccaall--hhaacckkss--rreeqquueesstt.
                   Although the  nature  of  such  correspondence
                   varies,  the  most  usual  topic is how to get
                   access to archives for the  BBoard.   In  such
                   cases,  if  the  archives  are  on-line in the
                   ~bboards/archive/ area, then you should  refer
                   the  BBoard user to the appropriate files.  If
                   not, then you should  contact  the  _P_o_s_t_M_a_s_t_e_r
                   and  ask  for archive retrieval.  Archives may
                   be accessed through the  normal  _b_b_c  and  _m_s_h
                   programs,  using the `-archive' switch to _b_b_c.
              BBBBooaarrdd lleeaaddeerrss : You may have  to  correspond  with

                   list  for  the  BBoard.   Their   address   is
