DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _S_l_o_c_a_l is a program designed to allow  you  to  have  your
       inbound  mail  processed  according  to  a  complex set of
       selection criteria.  You do  not  normally  invoke  _s_l_o_c_a_l
       yourself,  rather _s_l_o_c_a_l is invoked on your behalf by your
       system's Message Transfer Agent.

       The message selection criteria used by _s_l_o_c_a_l is specified
       in  the  file  _._m_a_i_l_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y in the user's home directory.
       The format of this file is given below.

       The message delivery address and message sender are deter-
       mined  from  the  Message Transfer Agent envelope informa-
       tion,  if  possible.   Under  _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l,  the  sender  will
       obtained from the UUCP "From " line, if present.  The user
       may override these values with command line arguments,  or
       arguments to the `-addr' and `-sender' switches.

       The message is normally read from the standard input.  The
       `-file' switch sets the name of the file  from  which  the
       message  should  be  read,  instead of reading stdin.  The
       `-user' switch tells _s_l_o_c_a_l the name of the user for  whom
       it is delivering mail.  The `-mailbox' switch tells _s_l_o_c_a_l
       the name of the user's maildrop file.

       The `-info' switch may be used to pass an arbitrary  argu-
       ment  to  sub-processes  which  _s_l_o_c_a_l  may invoke on your
       behalf.  The  `-verbose'  switch  causes  _s_l_o_c_a_l  to  give
       information  on  stdout  about its progress.  The `-debug'
       switch produces more verbose debugging output on stderr.

       If your MTA is _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l, you should include the line

                "| /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/slocal -user username"

       in your .forward file in your home directory.   This  will
       cause _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l to invoke _s_l_o_c_a_l on your behalf.

       /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/slocal to the file bin/rcvmail  in
       your  home  directory.   This  will cause _M_M_D_F_-_I to invoke
       _s_l_o_c_a_l    on    your    behalf    with     the     correct
       "_a_d_d_r_e_s_s _i_n_f_o _s_e_n_d_e_r" arguments.

       If  your  MTA  is _M_M_D_F_-_I_I, then you should not use _s_l_o_c_a_l.
       An equivalent functionality is already provided  by  _M_M_D_F_-

       The _._m_a_i_l_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y file controls how local delivery is per-
       formed.  Each line of this file consists of  five  fields,
       separated  by  white-space  or comma.  Since double-quotes
       are honored, these characters may be included in a  single
       argument  by  enclosing  the  entire  argument  in double-
       quotes.  A double-quote can be included  by  preceding  it
       with  a  backslash.  Lines beginning with `#' are ignored.
       The format of each line in the _._m_a_i_l_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y file is:

       hheeaaddeerr:
            The name of a header field that is to be searched for
            a  pattern.   This is any field in the headers of the
            message that might be present.  The following special
            fields are also defined:

       ppaatttteerrnn:
            The  sequence of characters to match in the specified
            header field.  Matching is case-insensitive, but does
            not use regular expressions.

       aaccttiioonn:
            The action to take to deliver the message:

                      Prior to giving the string to the shell, it

                      This  action  can  be used to avoid quoting
                      special characters which your  shell  might
                      interpret.

                      delivered.

            _R         Perform the action.  Regardless of the out-
                      come of the action, the message is not con-

                      delivered.

       the same rules.  This file must be owned by the  root  and

       performed.

       When  a  process  is  invoked,  its  environment  is:  the
       user/group-ids  are  set  to  recipient's ids; the working
       directory is the recipient's home directory; the umask  is
       0077;  the  process has no /dev/tty; the standard input is
       set to the message; the  standard  output  and  diagnostic
       output  are  set  to /dev/null; all other file-descriptors
       are closed; the envariables $$UUSSEERR, $$HHOOMMEE, $$SSHHEELLLL  are  set
       appropriately, and no other envariables exist.

       The  process is given a certain amount of time to execute.
       If the process does not exit within this limit,  the  pro-
       cess  will  be  terminated  with  extreme  prejudice.  The
       amount of time is  calculated  as  ((size  x  60)  +  300)

       seconds, where size is the number of bytes in the message.

       The exit status of the process is consulted in determining
       the  success  of the action.  An exit status of zero means
       that the action succeeded.   Any  other  exit  status  (or
       abnormal  termination)  means  that the action failed.  In
       order to avoid any time limitations, you might implement a
       process  that  began  by _f_o_r_k_i_n_g.  The parent would return
       the appropriate value immediately,  and  the  child  could
       continue  on,  doing  whatever it wanted for as long as it
       wanted.  This approach is somewhat risky if the parent  is
       going  to return an exit status of zero.  If the parent is
       going to return a non-zero exit status, then this approach
       can lead to quicker delivery into your maildrop.
