       The _m_s_g_c_h_k program checks all known mail  drops  for  mail
       waiting for you.  For those drops which have mail for you,
       _m_s_g_c_h_k will indicate if it believes that you have seen the
       mail in question before.

       The  `-notify type'  switch  indicates  under what circum-
       stances _m_s_g_c_h_k should produce a message.  The  default  is
       `-notify all'  which says that _m_s_g_c_h_k should always report
       the status of the users maildrop.  Other values for `type'
       include  `mail'  which  says that _m_s_g_c_h_k should report the
       status of waiting mail;  and,  `nomail'  which  says  that
       _m_s_g_c_h_k  should  report the status of empty maildrops.  The
       `-nonotify type'  switch  has  the  inverted   sense,   so
       `-nonotify all'  directs _m_s_g_c_h_k to never report the status
       of maildrops.  This is useful if the user wishes to  check
       _m_s_g_c_h_k's  exit  status.   A non-zero exit status indicates
       that mail was nnoott waiting for at least one  of  the  indi-
       cated users.

       If _m_s_g_c_h_k produces output, then the `-date' switch directs
       _m_s_g_c_h_k to print out the last date mail was read,  if  this
       can be determined.

       If the local host is configured as a POP client, or if the
       `-host host' switch is given, _m_s_g_c_h_k will  query  the  POP
       service  host  as  to  the status of mail waiting.  If the
       `-user user' switch is not given, then the  current  user-
       name is used.  Normally, _m_s_g_c_h_k will prompt for a password
       to use.  However, if the `-apop' switch is  given,  _m_s_g_c_h_k
       will  generate  authentication  credentials to provide for
       origin authentication and replay protection, but which  do
       not  involve sending a password in the clear over the net-
       work.  Otherwise, if the `-rpop'  switch  is  given,  then
       _m_s_g_c_h_k will try to use a "trusted" connection (ala the BSD
       r-commands).
