       _W_h_o_m is used to expand the headers of a message into a set
       of addresses and optionally verify  that  those  addresses
       are deliverable at that time (if `-check' is given).

       The    `-draftfolder +folder'    and   `-draftmessage msg'
       switches invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This is  an
       advanced   (and   highly  useful)  feature.   Consult  the
       AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess section of the _M_H manual for more infor-
       mation.

       The  files specified by the profile entry "Aliasfile:" and
       any additional alias files given by the `-alias aliasfile'
       switch  will  be read (more than one file, each  preceeded
       by `-alias', can be named).   See  _m_h_-_a_l_i_a_s (5)  for  more
       information.

       With  the  `-check'  option, _w_h_o_m makes no guarantees that
       the addresses listed as being ok are  really  deliverable,
       rather,  an  address  being listed as ok means that at the
       time that _w_h_o_m was run  the  address  was  thought  to  be
       deliverable   by   the   transport   service.   For  local

       addresses, this is absolute;  for  network  addresses,  it
       means  that  the  host  is  known;  for uucp addresses, it
       (often) means that the _U_U_C_P network is available for  use.
