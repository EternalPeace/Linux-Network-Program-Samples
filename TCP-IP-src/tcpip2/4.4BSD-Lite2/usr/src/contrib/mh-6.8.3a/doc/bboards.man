       The  home  directory of _b_b_o_a_r_d_s is where the BBoard system
       is kept.  This documentation describes some of the nuances
       of the BBoard system.

       Note  that if your system is configured to use the Network
       News Transfer Protocol (NNNNTTPP) to read BBoards, (your  sys-
       tem does seem to be configured this way), then there is no
       local bboards setup; instead, _b_b_c opens an NNNNTTPP connection
       to the local server.

            A  BBoard  is  just a file containing a group of mes-
            sages relating to the same topic.  These  files  live
            in  the  ~bboards  home directory.  Each message in a
            BBoard file has in its header  the  line  "BBoard-Id:
            n",  where  "n" is an ascending decimal number.  This
            id-number is unique for each  message  in  a  BBoards
            file.   It  should  NOT  be confused with the message
            number of a message, which can change as messages are
            removed from the BBoard.

       BBBBooaarrdd HHaannddlliinngg
            To  read  BBoards, use the _b_b_c and _m_s_h programs.  The
            _m_s_h command is a monolithic  program  which  contains
            all the functionality of _M_H in a single program.  The
            `-check' switch to _b_b_c lets you check on  the  status
            of  BBoards,  and  the  `-read'  switch  tells _b_b_c to
            invoke _m_s_h to read those BBoards.

       CCrreeaattiinngg aa BBBBooaarrdd
            Both public, and private BBoards are supported.  Con-
            tact  the  mail  address  _P_o_s_t_M_a_s_t_e_r if you'd like to
            have a BBoard created.

       BBBBooaarrdd aaddddrreesssseess
            Each BBoard has associated with it 4 addresses, these
            are (for the ficticious BBoard called ``hacks''):
              hhaacckkss : The Internet wide distribution list.
              ddiisstt--hhaacckkss : The local BBoard.
              hhaacckkss--rreeqquueesstt :  The  people  responsible  for  the
                   BBoard at the Internet level.
              llooccaall--hhaacckkss--rreeqquueesstt : The  people  responsible  for
                   the BBoard locally.
