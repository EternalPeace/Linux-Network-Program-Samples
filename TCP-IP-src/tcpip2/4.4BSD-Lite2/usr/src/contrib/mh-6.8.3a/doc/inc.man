       _I_n_c incorporates mail from the user's incoming  mail  drop
       into an _M_H folder.  If `+folder' isn't specified, a folder
       in the user's _M_H directory will be used, either that spec-
       ified  by the "Inbox:" entry in the user's profile, or the
       folder named "inbox".  The new messages being incorporated
       are assigned numbers starting with the next highest number
       in the folder.   If  the  specified  (or  default)  folder
       doesn't  exist, the user will be queried prior to its cre-
       ation.  As the messages are processed, a _s_c_a_n  listing  of
       the new mail is produced.

       If the user's profile contains a "Msg-Protect: nnn" entry,
       it will be used as the protection  on  the  newly  created
       messages,  otherwise  the _M_H default of 0644 will be used.
       During all operations on messages, this initially assigned
       protection will be preserved for each message, so _c_h_m_o_d(1)
       may be used to set a protection on an individual  message,
       and its protection will be preserved thereafter.

       If the switch `-audit audit-file' is specified (usually as
       a default switch in the profile), then _i_n_c will  append  a
       header line and a line per message to the end of the spec-
       ified audit-file with the format:

          inc date
               <scan line for first message>
               <scan line for second message>
                         <etc.>

       This is useful for keeping track of volume and  source  of
       incoming mail.  Eventually, _r_e_p_l, _f_o_r_w, _c_o_m_p, and _d_i_s_t may
       also produce audits to this  (or  another)  file,  perhaps
       with "Message-Id:" information to keep an exact correspon-
       dence history.  "Audit-file" will  be  in  the  user's  MH
       directory unless a full path is specified.

       _I_n_c  will  incorporate  even improperly formatted messages
       into the user's MH folder, inserting a blank line prior to
       the offending component and printing a comment identifying

       the bad message.

       In all cases, the user's mail drop will be zeroed,  unless
       the `-notruncate' switch is given.

       If  the  profile  entry  "Unseen-Sequence"  is present and
       non-empty, then _i_n_c will add each of  the  newly  incorpo-
       rated  messages  to  each  sequence  named  by the profile
       entry.  This is similar to the "Previous-Sequence" profile
       entry  supported  by  all _M_H commands which take `msgs' or
       `msg'  arguments.   Note  that  _i_n_c  will  not  zero  each
       sequence prior to adding messages.

       The     interpretation    of    the    `-form formatfile',
       `-format string', and  `-width columns'  switches  is  the
       same as in _s_c_a_n (1).

       By  using  the  `-file name' switch, one can direct _i_n_c to
       incorporate messages from a file  other  than  the  user's
       maildrop.   Note  that  the  name file will NOT be zeroed,
       unless the `-truncate' switch is given.

       If the envariable $$MMAAIILLDDRROOPP is set, then _i_n_c  uses  it  as
       the location of the user's maildrop instead of the default
       (the `-file name' switch still overrides  this,  however).
       If  this  envariable is not set, then _i_n_c will consult the
       profile entry "MailDrop" for  this  information.   If  the
       value  found is not absolute, then it is interpreted rela-
       tive to the user's _M_H directory.   If  the  value  is  not
       found,  then _i_n_c will look in the standard system location
       for the user's maildrop.

       The `-silent' switch directs _i_n_c to be quiet and  not  ask
       any  questions  at all.  This is useful for putting _i_n_c in
       the background and going on to other things.

       If the local host is configured as a POP client, or if the
       `-host host'  switch is given, then _i_n_c will query the POP
       service host as to the status of  mail  waiting.   If  the
       `-user user'  switch  is not given, then the current user-
       name is used.  Normally, _i_n_c will prompt for a password to
       use.   However,  if  the `-apop' switch is given, _i_n_c will
       generate authentication credentials to provide for  origin
       authentication  and  replay  protection,  but which do not
       involve sending a password in the clear over the  network.
       Otherwise,  if  the `-rpop' switch is given, then _i_n_c will
       try  to  use  a  "trusted"  connection  (ala  the  BSD  r-
       commands).

       If  _i_n_c  uses POP, then the `-pack file' switch is consid-
       ered.  If given, then _i_n_c simply uses the POP to _p_a_c_k_f (1)

       the user's maildrop from the POP service host to the named
       file.  This switch is provided for those users who  prefer
       to use _m_s_h to read their maildrops.

       The folder into which messages are being incorporated will
       become the current folder.  The first message incorporated
       will become the current message, unless the `-nochangecur'
       option is specified.  This leaves the context ready for  a
       _s_h_o_w of the first new message.

       The  argument  to the `-format' switch must be interpreted
       as a single token by the shell that invokes  _i_n_c.   There-
       fore,  one  must usually place the argument to this switch
       inside double-quotes.
