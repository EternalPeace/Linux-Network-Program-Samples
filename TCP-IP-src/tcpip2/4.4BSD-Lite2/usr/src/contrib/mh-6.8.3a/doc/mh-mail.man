       mh-mail - message format for MH message system

       _M_H  processes  messages in a particular format.  It should
       be noted that although neither Bell nor  Berkeley  mailers
       produce  message  files  in the format that _M_H prefers, _M_H
       can read message files in that antiquated format.

       Each user  possesses  a  mail  drop  box  which  initially
       receives all messages processed by _p_o_s_t (8).  _I_n_c (1) will
       read from that drop box and incorporate the  new  messages
       found  there  into  the user's own mail folders (typically
       `+inbox').  The mail drop box consists of one or more mes-
       sages.

       Messages are expected to consist of lines of text.  Graph-
       ics and binary data are not handled.  No data  compression
       is accepted.  All text is clear ASCII 7-bit data.

       The  general  "memo" framework of RFC-822 is used.  A mes-
       sage consists of a block of information in a rigid format,
       followed  by  general  text with no specified format.  The
       rigidly formatted first part of a message  is  called  the
       header,  and  the  free-format portion is called the body.
       The header must always exist, but the  body  is  optional.
       These parts are separated by an empty line, i.e., two con-
       secutive newline characters.  Within _M_H,  the  header  and
       body may be separated by a line consisting of dashes:

            To:
            cc:
            Subject:
            --------

       The  header is composed of one or more header items.  Each
       header item can be viewed as  a  single  logical  line  of
       ASCII  characters.   If  the text of a header item extends
       across several real  lines,  the  continuation  lines  are
       indicated by leading spaces or tabs.

       Each  header item is called a component and is composed of
       a keyword or name, along with associated text.   The  key-
       word  begins at the left margin, may NOT contain spaces or
       tabs, may  not  exceed  63  characters  (as  specified  by
       RFC-822),  and  is  terminated  by a colon (`:').  Certain
       components (as identified by their keywords)  must  follow
       rigidly defined formats in their text portions.

MH-MAIL(5)           BSD Programmer's Manual           MH-MAIL(5)


       The  text for most formatted components (e.g., "Date:" and
       "Message-Id:") is produced automatically.  The  only  ones
       entered  by  the  user  are  address fields such as "To:",
       "cc:", etc.  Internet addresses are assigned mailbox names
       and  host  computer  specifications.   The rough format is
       "local@domain", such as "MH@UCI",  or  "MH@UCI-ICSA.ARPA".
       Multiple  addresses  are  separated  by commas.  A missing
       host/domain is assumed to be the local host/domain.

       As mentioned above, a blank line (or  a  line  of  dashes)
       signals  that all following text up to the end of the file
       is the body.  No formatting is expected or enforced within
       the body.

       Following  is a list of header components that are consid-
       ered meaningful to various MH programs.
       Date:
            Added by _p_o_s_t (8), contains date and time of the mes-
            sage's entry into the transport system.
       From:
            Added by _p_o_s_t (8), contains the address of the author
            or authors (may be more than one if a "Sender:" field
            is  present).   Replies  are  typically  directed  to
            addresses in the "Reply-To:" or  "From:"  field  (the
            former has precedence if present).

       Sender:
            Added  by  _p_o_s_t (8)  in  the  event  that the message
            already has a "From:" line.  This line  contains  the
            address of the actual sender.  Replies are never sent
            to addresses in the "Sender:" field.

       To:
            Contains addresses of primary recipients.

       cc:
            Contains addresses of secondary recipients.

       Bcc:
            Still more recipients.  However, the "Bcc:"  line  is
            not  copied  onto  the message as delivered, so these
            recipients are not listed.  _M_H uses an  encapsulation
            method for blind copies, see _s_e_n_d (1).

       Fcc:
            Causes  _p_o_s_t (8)  to copy the message into the speci-
            fied folder for the sender, if the message  was  suc-
            cessfully given to the transport system.

       Message-ID:
            A  unique message identifier added by _p_o_s_t (8) if the

            `-msgid' flag is set.

       Subject:
            Sender's commentary.  It is displayed by _s_c_a_n (1).

       In-Reply-To:
            A commentary line added by _r_e_p_l (1) when replying  to
            a message.

       Resent-Date:
            Added when redistributing a message by _p_o_s_t (8).

       Resent-From:
            Added when redistributing a message by _p_o_s_t (8).

       Resent-To:
            New recipients for a message resent by _d_i_s_t (1).

       Resent-cc:
            Still more recipients.  See "cc:" and "Resent-To:".

       Resent-Bcc:
            Even more recipients.  See "Bcc:" and "Resent-To:".

       Resent-Fcc:
            Copy  resent  message  into a folder.  See "Fcc:" and
            "Resent-To:".

       Resent-Message-Id:
            A unique identifier  glued  on  by  _p_o_s_t (8)  if  the
            `-msgid'   flag   is   set.   See  "Message-Id:"  and
            "Resent-To:".
       Resent:
            Annotation for _d_i_s_t (1) under the `-annotate' option.

       Forwarded:
            Annotation for _f_o_r_w (1) under the `-annotate' option.

       Replied:
