       _v_m_h is a program which implements the server side  of  the
       _M_H window management protocol and uses _c_u_r_s_e_s (3) routines
       to maintain a split-screen interface to any program  which
       implements  the  client side of the protocol.  This latter
       program,  called  the  _v_m_h_p_r_o_c,  is  specified  using  the
       `-vmhproc program' switch.

       The  upshot  of all this is that one can run _m_s_h on a dis-
       play terminal and get a  nice  visual  interface.   To  do
       this, for example, just add the line

            mshproc: vmh

       to  your  .mh_profile.   (This takes advantage of the fact
       that _m_s_h is the default _v_m_h_p_r_o_c for _v_m_h.)

       In order to facilitate things, if the `-novmhproc'  switch
       is  given,  and  _v_m_h can't run on the user's terminal, the
       _v_m_h_p_r_o_c is run directly without the window management pro-
       tocol.

       After  initializing the protocol, _v_m_h prompts the user for
       a command to  be  given  to  the  client.   Usually,  this
       results in output being sent to one or more windows.  If a
       output to a window would cause it to scroll,  _v_m_h  prompts
       the user for instructions, roughly permitting the capabil-
       ities of _l_e_s_s or _m_o_r_e (e.g., the ability to  scroll  back-
       wards and forwards):

            SPACE      advance to the next windowful
            RETURN  *  advance to the next line
            y       *  retreat to the previous line
            d       *  advance to the next ten lines
            u       *  retreat to the previous ten lines
            g       *  go to an arbitrary line
                       (preceed g with the line number)
            G       *  go to the end of the window
                       (if a line number is given, this acts like `g')
            CTRL-L     refresh the entire screen
            h          print a help message
            q          abort the window

       this command.)

       Note that if a command resulted in more than one  window's
       worth  of  information  being displayed, and you allow the
       command which is generating information for the window  to
       gracefully  finish (i.e., you don't use the `q' command to
       abort information being sent to the window), then _v_m_h will
       give  you  one  last change to peruse the window.  This is
       useful for scrolling back and forth.  Just type  `q'  when
       you're done.

       To  abnormally  terminate  _v_m_h  (without  core  dump), use
       <QUIT> (usually CTRL-\).   For  instance,  this  does  the
       "right" thing with _b_b_c and _m_s_h.

       The  argument  to the `-prompt' switch must be interpreted
       as a single token by the shell that invokes  _v_m_h.   There-
       fore,  one  must usually place the argument to this switch
       inside double-quotes.

       At present, there is no way to pass signals (e.g.,  inter-
       rupt,  quit) to the client.  However, generating QUIT when
       _v_m_h is reading a command from the terminal  is  sufficient
       to tell the client to go away quickly.

       Acts  strangely  (loses  peer or botches window management
       protocol with peer) on random occasions.
