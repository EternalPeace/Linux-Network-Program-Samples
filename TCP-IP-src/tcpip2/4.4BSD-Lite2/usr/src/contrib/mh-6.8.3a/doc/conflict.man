       _C_o_n_f_l_i_c_t is a program that checks to see if the  interface
       between _M_H and transport system is in good shape

       _C_o_n_f_l_i_c_t  also  checks for maildrops in /var/mail which do
       not belong to a valid user.  It assumes that no user  name
       will  start  with `.', and thus ignores files in /var/mail
       which begin with `.'.  It also checks for entries  in  the
       _g_r_o_u_p (5)  file  which  do not belong to a valid user, and
       for users who do not have a valid group number.  In  addi-
       tion duplicate users and groups are noted.

       If  the `-mail name' switch is used, then the results will
       be sent to the specified _n_a_m_e.  Otherwise, the results are
       sent to the standard output.

       The  `-search directory'  switch  can  be  used  to search
       directories other than /var/mail and to  report  anomalies
       in  those directories.  The `-search directory' switch can
       appear more than one time in an invocation to _c_o_n_f_l_i_c_t.

       _C_o_n_f_l_i_c_t should be run under  _c_r_o_n (8), or whenever system
       accounting takes place.
