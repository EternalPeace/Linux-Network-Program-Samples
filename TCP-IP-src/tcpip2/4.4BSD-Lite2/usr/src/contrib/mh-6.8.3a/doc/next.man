       next  [+folder]  [-header] [-noheader] [-showproc program]

       _N_e_x_t performs a _s_h_o_w on the next message in the  specified
       (or current) folder.  Like _s_h_o_w, it passes any switches on
       to the program _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c, which is called to list the  mes-
       sage.   This command is almost exactly equivalent to "show
       next".  Consult the manual entry for _s_h_o_w (1) for all  the
       details.

       `+folder' defaults to the current folder
       `-header'

CCOONNTTEEXXTT
       If  a  folder  is  specified,  it  will become the current
       folder.  The message that is shown (i.e., the next message
       in sequence) will become the current message.

BBUUGGSS
       _n_e_x_t  is  really a link to the _s_h_o_w program.  As a result,
       if you make a link to _n_e_x_t and that  link  is  not  called
       _n_e_x_t, your link will act like _s_h_o_w instead.  To circumvent
       this, add a profile-entry for the link to your _M_H  profile
       and add the argument _n_e_x_t to the entry.
