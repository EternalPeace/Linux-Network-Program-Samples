       _A_p  is  a  program  that parses addresses according to the
       ARPA  Internet  standard.   It   also   understands   many
       non-standard formats.  It is useful for seeing how _M_H will
       interpret an address.

       The _a_p  program  treats  each  argument  as  one  or  more
       addresses,  and prints those addresses out in the official
       822-format.  Hence, it is usually  best  to  enclose  each
       argument in double-quotes for the shell.

       To   override   the   output   format   used  by  _a_p,  the
       `-format string'  or  `-format file'  switches  are  used.
       This  permits  individual  fields  of  the  address  to be
       extracted with  ease.   The  string  is  simply  a  format
       stringand   thefile   is   simply   a  format  file.   See
       _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) for the details.

       In addition to the standard escapes,  _a_p  also  recognizes
       the following additional escape:

       _E_s_c_a_p_e  _R_e_t_u_r_n_s  _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
       error   string   A diagnostic if the parse failed

       If  the `-normalize' switch is given, _a_p will try to track
       down the official hostname of the address.

       Here is the default format string used by _a_p:

            %<{error}%{error}: %{text}%|%(putstr(proper{text}))%>

       which says that if an error was detected, print the error,
       a `:', and the address in error.   Otherwise,  output  the
       822-proper format of the address.

       The argument to the `-format' switch must  be  interpreted
       as  a  single  token by the shell that invokes _a_p.  There-
       fore, one must usually place the argument to  this  switch
       inside double-quotes.

       On  hosts  where  _M_H  was configured with the BERK option,
       address parsing is not enabled.
