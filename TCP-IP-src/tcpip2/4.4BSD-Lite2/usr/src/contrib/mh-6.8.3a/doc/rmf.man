       _R_m_f  removes all of the messages (files) within the speci-
       fied (or default) folder,  and  then  removes  the  folder
       (directory)  itself.   If  there  are any files within the
       folder which are not a  part  of  _M_H,  they  will  _n_o_t  be
       removed,  and an error will be produced.  If the folder is
       given explicitly or the `-nointeractive' option is  given,
       then  the  folder  will  be  removed without confirmation.
       Otherwise, the user will be asked  for  confirmation.   If
       _r_m_f  can't  find  the current folder, for some reason, the
       folder to be removed defaults to `+inbox' (unless overrid-
       den by user's profile entry "Inbox") with confirmation.

       _R_m_f  irreversibly  deletes  messages that don't have other
       links, so use it with caution.

       If the folder being removed is  a  subfolder,  the  parent
       folder  will  become  the new current folder, and _r_m_f will
       produce a message telling  the  user  this  has  happened.
       This  provides  an  easy  mechanism for selecting a set of
       messages, operating on the list, then  removing  the  list
       and  returning  to  the current folder from which the list
       was extracted.

       _R_m_f of a read-only folder will delete the private sequence
       and  cur information (i.e., "atr-_s_e_q-_f_o_l_d_e_r" entries) from
       the profile without affecting the folder itself.

       subfolder is removed; or if the current folder is removed,
       it will  make  "inbox"  current.   Otherwise,  it  doesn't
       change the current folder or message.

       Although  intuitively  one  would  suspect  that _r_m_f works
       recursively, it does not.  Hence if you have a  sub-folder
       within  a  folder,  in  order  to _r_m_f the parent, you must
       first _r_m_f each of the children.
