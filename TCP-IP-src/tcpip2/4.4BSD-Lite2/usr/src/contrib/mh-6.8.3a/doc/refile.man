       _R_e_f_i_l_e  moves  (_m_v (1))  or links (_l_n (1)) messages from a
       source folder into one or more  destination  folders.   If
       you think of a message as a sheet of paper, this operation
       is not unlike filing the sheet of  paper  (or  copies)  in
       file  cabinet  folders.   When  a  message is filed, it is
       linked into the destination folder(s) if possible, and  is
       copied  otherwise.  As long as the destination folders are
       all on the same file system, multiple filing causes little
       storage  overhead.   This  facility provides a good way to
       cross-file or multiply-index messages.  For example, if  a
       message is received from Jones about the ARPA Map Project,
       the command

            refile cur +jones +Map

       would allow the message to be found in either of  the  two
       folders `jones' or `Map'.

       The  option  `-file file' directs _r_e_f_i_l_e to use the speci-
       fied file as the source message to be filed, rather than a
       message  from  a  folder.   Note that the file should be a
       validly formatted message, just like any other _M_H message.
       It should NNOOTT be in mail drop format (to convert a file in
       mail drop format to a folder of _M_H messages, see _i_n_c (1)).

       If  a destination folder doesn't exist, _r_e_f_i_l_e will ask if
       you want to create it.  A negative response will abort the
       file operation.  If the standard input for _r_e_f_i_l_e is _n_o_t a
       tty, then _r_e_f_i_l_e will not ask any questions and will  pro-
       ceed as if the user answered "yes" to all questions.

       The option `-link' preserves the source folder copy of the
       message (i.e., it does  a  _l_n(1)  rather  than  a  _m_v(1)),
       whereas,  `-nolink'  deletes  the  filed messages from the
       source folder.  Normally, when a message is filed,  it  is
       assigned  the next highest number available in each of the
       destination folders.  Use of the `-preserve'  switch  will
       override  this  message  renaming,  but name conflicts may
       occur, so use this switch cautiously.

       If `-link' is not specified (or `-nolink'  is  specified),
       the filed messages will be removed from the source folder,

       by renaming them with a site-dependent prefix  (usually  a
       comma).

       If the user has a profile component such as

            rmmproc:  /bin/rm

       then  _r_e_f_i_l_e will instead call the named program to delete
       the message files.  The user may  specify  `-rmmproc  pro-
       gram'  on the command line to override this profile speci-
       fication.  The  `-normmproc'  option  forces  the  message
       files to be deleted by renaming them as described above.

       The   `-draft'   switch   tells   _r_e_f_i_l_e   to   file   the
       <mh-dir>/draft.

       If `-src +folder' is given, it  will  become  the  current
       folder.   If  neither  `-link' nor `all' is specified, the
       current message in the source folder will be  set  to  the
       last  message  specified;  otherwise,  the current message
       won't be changed.

       If the Previous-Sequence profile entry is set, in addition
       to  defining  the  named sequences from the source folder,
       _r_e_f_i_l_e will also define those sequences for  the  destina-
       tion  folders.   See  _m_h_-_s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e (5) for information con-
       cerning the previous sequence.

       Since _r_e_f_i_l_e uses your _r_m_m_p_r_o_c to delete the message,  the
       _r_m_m_p_r_o_c  must  NNOOTT call _r_e_f_i_l_e without specifying `-normm-
       proc', or you will create an infinte loop.
