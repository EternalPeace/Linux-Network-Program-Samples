       _W_h_a_t_n_o_w is the default program that queries the user about
       the disposition of  a  composed  draft.   It  is  normally
       invoked by one of _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, or _r_e_p_l after the ini-
       tial edit.

       When started, the editor is started on the  draft  (unless
       `-noedit' is given, in which case the initial edit is sup-
       pressed).  Then, _w_h_a_t_n_o_w  repetitively  prompts  the  user
       with  "What  now?"  and  awaits  a  response.   The  valid
       responses are:

     ddiissppllaayy         to list the message being distributed/replied-to on
                     the terminal
     eeddiitt            to re-edit using the same editor that was used on the
                     preceding round unless a profile entry
                     "<lasteditor>-next: <editor>" names an alternate editor
     eeddiitt <<eeddiittoorr>>   to invoke <editor> for further editing
     lliisstt            to list the draft on the terminal
     ppuusshh            to send the message in the background
     qquuiitt            to terminate the session and preserve the draft
     qquuiitt --ddeelleettee    to terminate, then delete the draft
     rreeffiillee ++ffoollddeerr  to refile the draft into the given folder
     sseenndd            to send the message
     sseenndd --wwaattcchh     to cause the delivery process to be monitored
     wwhhoomm            to list the addresses that the message will go to
     wwhhoomm --cchheecckk     to list the addresses and verify that they are
                     acceptable to the transport service

     For the eeddiitt response, any valid switch  to  the  editor  is
     valid.   Similarly,  for  the  sseenndd  and wwhhoomm responses, any
     valid switch to  _s_e_n_d (1)  and  _w_h_o_m (1)  commands,  respec-
     tively,  are valid.  For the ppuusshh response, any valid switch
     to _s_e_n_d (1) is valid (as this merely invokes _s_e_n_d  with  the
     `-push'  option).  For the _r_e_f_i_l_e response, any valid switch
     to  the  _f_i_l_e_p_r_o_c  is  valid.   For  the  ddiissppllaayy  and  lliisstt
     responses, any valid argument to the _l_p_r_o_c is valid.  If any
     non-switch arguments are present, then the pathname  of  the
     draft  will  be excluded from the argument list given to the
     _l_p_r_o_c (this is useful for listing another _M_H message).

     See _m_h_-_p_r_o_f_i_l_e (5) for further information about how editors
     are  used  by MH.  It also discusses how complex envariables

     can be used to direct _w_h_a_t_n_o_w's actions.

     The `-prompt string' switch sets the  prompting  string  for
     _w_h_a_t_n_o_w.

     The  `-draftfolder +folder' and `-draftmessage msg' switches
     invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This  is  an  advanced
     (and  highly useful) feature.  Consult the AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess
     section of the _M_H manual for more information.

       The argument to the `-prompt' switch must  be  interpreted
       as  a  single  token  by  the  shell that invokes _w_h_a_t_n_o_w.
       Therefore, one must usually place  the  argument  to  this
       switch inside double-quotes.

       If  the initial edit fails, _w_h_a_t_n_o_w deletes your draft (by
       renaming it with a leading comma); failure of a later edit
       preverves the draft.

       If _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c is _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, then _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l
       use a built-in _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, and do not actually run the  _w_h_a_t_-
       _n_o_w  program.   Hence, if you define your own _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c,
       don't call it _w_h_a_t_n_o_w since it won't be run.

       If _s_e_n_d_p_r_o_c is _s_e_n_d, then _w_h_a_t_n_o_w uses a built-in _s_e_n_d, it
