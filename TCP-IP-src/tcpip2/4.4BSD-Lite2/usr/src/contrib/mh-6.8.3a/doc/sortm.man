       _S_o_r_t_m  sorts  the  specified  messages in the named folder
       according to the chronological order of the "Date:"  field
       of each message.

       The  `-verbose'  switch directs _s_o_r_t_m to tell the user the
       general actions that it is taking to place the  folder  in
       sorted order.

       The  `-datefield field' switch tells _s_o_r_t_m the name of the
       field to use when making the date comparison.  If the user
       has  a special field in each message, such as "BB-Posted:"
       or "Delivery-Date:", then the `-datefield' switch  can  be
       used to direct _s_o_r_t_m which field to examine.

       The  `-textfield field'  switch  causes _s_o_r_t_m to sort mes-
       sages by the specified text field.  If this field is "sub-
       ject",  any  leading  "re:" is stripped off.  In any case,
       all characters except letters and numbers are stripped and
       the   resulting   strings   are   sorted  datefield-major,
       textfield-minor, using a case insensitive comparison.

       With `-textfield field', if  `-limit days'  is  specified,
       messages  with  similar  textfields  that are dated within
       `days'  of  each  other   appear   together.    Specifying
       `-nolimit' makes the limit infinity.  With `-limit 0', the
       sort is instead made textfield-major, date-minor.

       For example, to order a  folder  by  date-major,  subject-
       minor, use:

            sortm -textfield subject +folder

       If  a  folder is given, it will become the current folder.
       If the current message is moved, _s_o_r_t_m will  preserve  its
       status as current.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       Timezones  used  to  be ignored when comparing dates: they
       aren't any more.

       Messages which were in the folder, but  not  specified  by
       `msgs',  used  to  be  moved to the end of the folder; now
       such messages are left untouched.

       _S_o_r_t_m sometimes did not preserve the message numbering  in
       a  folder  (e.g.,  messages  1,  3, and 5, might have been
       renumbered to 1, 2, 3 after sorting).  This was a bug, and
       has  been  fixed.   To compress the message numbering in a
       folder, use "_f_o_l_d_e_r _-_p_a_c_k" as always.

BBUUGGSS
       If _s_o_r_t_m encounters a message without a date-field, or  if
       the message has a date-field that _s_o_r_t_m cannot parse, then
       _s_o_r_t_m attempts to keep the message in  the  same  relative
       position.   This  does  not always work.  For instance, if
       the first message encountered lacks a date  which  can  be
       parsed,  then  it will usually be placed at the end of the
       messages being sorted.

       When _s_o_r_t_m complains about a message which it can't tempo-
       rally  order,  it complains about the message number _p_r_i_o_r
       to sorting.  It should indicate what  the  message  number
       will be _a_f_t_e_r sorting.
