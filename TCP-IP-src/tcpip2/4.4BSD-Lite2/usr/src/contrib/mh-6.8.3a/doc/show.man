       _S_h_o_w  lists each of the specified messages to the standard
       output (typically, the terminal).  Typically, the messages
       are  listed  exactly as they are, with no reformatting.  A
       program named by the _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c profile component is invoked
       to do the listing, and any switches not recognized by _s_h_o_w
       are passed along to that program.  The default program  is
       known  as _m_o_r_e (1).  To override the default and the _s_h_o_w_-
       _p_r_o_c  profile  component,  use   the   `-showproc program'
       switch.   For  example,  `-show pr'  will cause the _p_r (1)
       program to list the messages.  The _M_H command _m_h_l  can  be
       used as a _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c to show messages in a more uniform for-
       mat.  Normally, this program is specified as the  _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c
       is  the  user's .mh_profile.  See _m_h_l (1) for the details.
       If the `-noshowproc' option is  specified,  `/bin/cat'  is
       used instead of _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c.

       If  you  have messages with multi-media contents, the pro-
       file entry _m_h_n_p_r_o_c defines the name of a program to manip-
       ulate  multi-media  messages.  (The _m_h_n (1) program, which
       is suitable for this purpose, is  the  default.)   If  the
       `-noshowproc'  option is NOT specified, and if one or more
       named messages has a multi-media content, then the program
       indicated by _m_h_n_p_r_o_c will be run instead of _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c.  The
       use of the _m_h_n_p_r_o_c can also be disabled if the environment
       variable  $$NNOOMMHHNNPPRROOCC is set.  Note that the _m_h_n_p_r_o_c may be
       invoked even for textual contents, depending on the  char-
       acter  set involved.  The environment variable $MM_CHARSET
       should be set to the terminal's  character  set  to  avoid
       gratuitous invocations of the _m_h_n_p_r_o_c.

       The  `-header'  switch  tells  _s_h_o_w  to display a one-line
       description of the message being shown.  This  description
       includes the folder and the message number.

       If  no  `msgs' are specified, the current message is used.
       If more than one message is specified,  _m_o_r_e  will  prompt
       for  a  <RETURN> prior to listing each message.  _m_o_r_e will
       list each message, a page at a time.  When the end of page
       is reached, _m_o_r_e will ring the bell and wait for a <SPACE>
       or <RETURN>.  If a <RETURN> is entered,  _m_o_r_e  will  print
       the next line, whereas <SPACE> will print the next screen-
       ful.  To exit _m_o_r_e, type "q".

       If the standard output is not a terminal, no  queries  are
       made,  and  each file is listed with a one-line header and
       two lines of separation.

       "show -draft" will list  the  file  <mh-dir>/draft  if  it
       exists.

       If  the  profile  entry  "Unseen-Sequence"  is present and
       non-empty, then _s_h_o_w will  remove  each  of  the  messages
       shown from each sequence named by the profile entry.  This
       is similar to the "Previous-Sequence" profile  entry  sup-
       ported by all _M_H commands which take `msgs' or `msg' argu-
       ments.

       The  `-header'  switch doesn't work when `msgs' expands to
       more than one message.  If the _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c is  _m_h_l,  then  is
       problem  can  be circumvented by referencing the "message-
       name" field in the _m_h_l format file.

       _S_h_o_w updates the user's context before  showing  the  mes-
       sage.   Hence _s_h_o_w will mark messages as seen prior to the
       user actually seeing them.  This is generally not a  prob-
       lem, unless the user relies on the "unseen" messages mech-
       anism, and interrupts _s_h_o_w while it  is  showing  "unseen"
       messages.

       If _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c is _m_h_l, then _s_h_o_w uses a built-in _m_h_l: it does
       not actually run the _m_h_l program.  Hence,  if  you  define
