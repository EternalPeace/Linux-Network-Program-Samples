       The file  /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/mtstailor  defines  run-
       time options for those _M_H programs which interact (in some
       form) with the  message  transport  system.   At  present,
       these (user) programs are: _a_p, _c_o_n_f_l_i_c_t, _i_n_c, _m_s_g_c_h_k, _m_s_h,
       _p_o_s_t, _r_c_v_d_i_s_t, and _r_c_v_p_a_c_k.

       Each option should be given on a single line.  Blank lines
       and  lines  which begin with `#' are ignored.  The options
       available along with default values and a  description  of
       their meanings are listed below:

       localname:
            The  host  name  _M_H  considers  local.   If  not set,
            depending on the version of UNIX you're  running,  _M_H
            will   query   the   system  for  this  value  (e.g.,
            <whoami.h>, gethostname, etc.).  This has no  equiva-
            lent  in the _M_H configuration file.  POP client hosts
            should set this value to the name of the POP  service
            host.

       localdomain:
            If this is set, a `.' followed by this string will be
            appended to your host name.  This might be useful for
            sites  where  the  host  name  returned by the system
            (e.g.,  <whoami.h>,  gethostname,  etc.),  is  not  a
            "fully qualified domain name" (i.e., does not contain
            a `.').

       clientname:
            The host name _M_H will give  in  the  SMTP  HHEELLOO  (and
            EEHHLLOO)  command,  when  posting mail.  If not set, the
            host name _M_H considers local is used (see "localname"
            above).   If  empty,  no  HHEELLOO command will be given.
            Although the HHEELLOO command is  required  by  RFC  821,
            many SMTP servers do not require it.

            Early versions of SendMail will fail if the host name
            given in the HHEELLOO command is the  local  host;  later
            versions  of  SendMail  will complain if you omit the
            HHEELLOO command.  If you run  SendMail,  find  out  what
            your system expects and set this field if needed.

MH-TAILOR(5)         BSD Programmer's Manual         MH-TAILOR(5)


       systemname:
            The  name of the local host in the _U_U_C_P "domain".  If
            not set, depending on the version of UNIX you're run-
            ning,  _M_H will query the system for this value.  This
            has no equivalent in the _M_H configuration file.

       mmdfldir: /var/mail
            The directory where maildrops are kept.  If  this  is
            empty, the user's home directory is used.  This over-
            rides the "mail" field in the _M_H configuration  file.

       mmdflfil:
            The  name of the maildrop file in the directory where
            maildrops are kept.  If this  is  empty,  the  user's
            login  name is used.  This overrides the "mail" field
            in the _M_H configuration file.

       mmdelim1: \001\001\001\001\n
            The beginning-of-message delimiter for maildrops.

       mmdelim2: \001\001\001\001\n
            The end-of-message delimiter for maildrops.

       mmailid: 0
            If non-zero, then support for MMailids in //eettcc//ppaasssswwdd
            is  enabled.   Basically,  the  pw_gecos field in the
            password file is of the form

                 My Full Name <mailid>

            The _M_H internal routines that deal with user and full
            names will return "mailid" and "My Full Name" respec-
            tively.

       lockstyle: 0
            The locking discipline to perform.  A  value  of  "0"
            means to use kernel-level locking if available.  (See
            below for more details.)  On systems compiled without
            kernel-level  locking,  standard  _B_e_l_l_M_a_i_l locking is
            used.  A value of "1" means to use  _B_e_l_l_M_a_i_l  locking
            always  (the  name  of  the lock is based on the file
            name).  A value of "2"  means  to  use  _M_M_D_F  locking
            always (the name of the lock is based on device/inode
            pairs).

       lockldir:
            The name of the directory for making locks.  If  your
            system  isn't configured to use kernel-level locking,
            then this directory is used when creating locks.   If
            the value is empty, then the directory of the file to
            be locked is used.

MH-TAILOR(5)         BSD Programmer's Manual         MH-TAILOR(5)


       maildelivery: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/maildelivery
            The name of  the  system-wide  default  _._m_a_i_l_d_e_l_i_v_e_r_y
            file.  See _m_h_o_o_k (1) for the details.

       everyone: 200
            The  highest  user-id  which  should NOT receive mail
            addressed to "everyone".

       noshell:
            If set, then each  user-id  greater  than  "everyone"
            that  has a login shell equivalent to the given value
            (e.g., "/bin/csh") indicates that mail for "everyone"
            should  not be sent to them.  This is useful for han-
            dling admin, dummy, and guest logins.

   MMaaiill FFiilltteerriinngg
       These options are only available if you compiled  _M_H  with
       "options MF".

       uucpchan: name of _U_U_C_P channel
            Usually  "UUCP".   This  has  no equivalent in the _M_H
            configuration file.

       uucpldir: /usr/spool/mail
            The name of the directory where  _U_U_C_P  maildrops  are
            kept.  This has no equivalent in the _M_H configuration
            file.

       uucplfil:
            The name of the maildrop file in the directory  where
            _U_U_C_P  maildrops  are  kept.   If  this  is empty, the
            user's login name is used.  This has no equivalent in
            the _M_H configuration file.

       umincproc: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/uminc
            The path to the program that filters _U_U_C_P-style mail-
            drops to _M_M_D_F-style maildrops.

   SSttaanndd--AAlloonnee DDeelliivveerryy
       These options are only available if you compiled _M_H to use
       stand-alone delivery (i.e., "mts: mh").

       mailqdir: /usr/spool/netmail
            The directory where network mail is queued.

       tmailqdir: /usr/tmp
            The  directory  where  network  mail  queue files are
            built.

       syscpy: 1
            If ON, unauthorized mail is copied to the overseer.

       overseer: root
            The user that receives reports of unauthorized  mail.

       mailer: root
            The user acting for the mail system.

       fromtmp: /tmp/rml.f.XXXXXX
            The _m_k_t_e_m_p template for storing from lines.

       msgtmp: /tmp/rml.m.XXXXXX
            The  _m_k_t_e_m_p template for storing the rest of the mes-
            sage.

       errtmp: /tmp/rml.e.XXXXXX
            The _m_k_t_e_m_p template for storing error  messages  from
            other mailers.

       tmpmode: 0600
            The octal mode which temporary files are set to.

       okhosts: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/Rmail.OKHosts
            A  file  containing  a  list  of  hosts that can send
            ARPAnet mail.

       okdests: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/RMail.OKDests
            A file containing a list of  hosts  that  can  always
            receive mail.

   TThhee ``//ssmmttpp'' MMTTSS SSuuffffiixx
       These  options  are only available if you compiled _M_H with
       the "/smtp" suffix to your "mts:" configuration.

       hostable: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/hosts
            The exceptions file for /etc/hosts used  by  _p_o_s_t  to
            try  to find official names.  The format of this file
            is quite simple:

                 1. Comments are surrounded by  sharp  (`#')  and
                 newline.
                 2. Words are surrounded by white space.
                 3.  The  first  word on the line is the official
                 name of a host.
                 4. All words following the  official  names  are
                 aliases for that host.

       servers: localhost \01localnet
            A  lists of hosts and networks which to look for SMTP
            servers when posting local mail.  It turns  out  this
            is  a  major win for hosts which don't run an message
            transport system.  The value of "servers"  should  be
            one or more items.  Each item is the name of either a

            host or a net (in the latter case, precede  the  name
            of  the  net  by  a \01).  This list is searched when
            looking for a smtp server to post mail.  If a host is
            present,  the  SMTP port on that host is tried.  If a
            net is present, the SMTP port on each  host  in  that
            net  is tried.  Note that if you are running with the
            BIND code, then any networks  specified  are  ignored
            (sorry, the interface went away under BIND).

   SSeennddMMaaiill
       This  option  is  only available if you compiled _M_H to use
       _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l as your delivery agent (i.e., "mts: sendmail").

       sendmail: /usr/lib/sendmail
            The pathname to the _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l program.

   PPoosstt OOffffiiccee PPrroottooccooll
       This option is only available if you compiled _M_H with  POP
       support enabled (i.e., "pop: on").

       pophost:
            The name of the default POP service host.  If this is
            not set, then _M_H looks in the standard maildrop areas
            for  waiting  mail,  otherwise  the named POP service
            host is consulted.

   BBBBooaarrddss DDeelliivveerryy
       This option is only available  if  you  compiled  _M_H  with
       "bbdelivery: on".

       bbdomain:
            The local BBoards domain (a UCI hack).

   BBBBooaarrddss && TThhee PPOOPP
       These  options  are only available if you compiled _M_H with
       "bboards: pop" and "pop: on".

       popbbhost:
            The POP service host which  also  acts  as  a  BBoard
            server.   This  variable  should  be  set  on the POP
            BBoards client host.

       popbbuser:
            The guest account on the POP/BB service  host.   This
            should  be  a  different login ID than either the POP
            user or the BBoards  user.   (The  user-id  "ftp"  is
            highly  recommended.)  This variable should be set on
            both the POP BBoards client and service hosts.

       popbblist: /usr/contrib/mh-6.8/lib/hosts.popbb
            A file containing of lists of hosts that are  allowed

            to  use  the POP facility to access BBoards using the
            guest account.  If this file is not present, then  no
            check  is  made.   This variable should be set on the
            POP BBoards service host.

   BBBBooaarrddss && TThhee NNNNTTPP
       This option is only available  if  you  compiled  _M_H  with
       "bboards: nntp" and "pop: on".

       nntphost:
            The host which provides the NNTP service.  This vari-
            able should be set on the NNTP BBoards client host.

   FFiillee LLoocckkiinngg
       A few words on locking: _M_H has a flexible  locking  system
       for  making locks on files.  There are two mmttssttaaiilloorr vari-
       ables you should be aware of "lockstyle"  and  "lockldir".
       The  first controls the method of locking, the second says
       where lock files should be created.

       The "lockstyle" variable can take on three values:  0,  1,
       2.   A  value  of 0 is useful on systems with kernel-level
       locking.  If you are on a BBSSDD4422  system,  _M_H  assumes  you
       have  the  _f_l_o_c_k  system  call.   On other systems: define
       FFLLOOCCKK if you want to use the  _f_l_o_c_k  system  call;  define
       LLOOCCKKFF  if you want to use the _l_o_c_k_f system call; or define
       FFCCNNTTLL if you want to use the _f_c_n_t_l system call for kernel-
       level  locking.   If you haven't configured _M_H to use ker-
       nel-level locking, a locking style of 0 is considered  the
       same as locking style 1.

       A  value of 1 or 2 specifies that a file should be created
       whose existence means  "locked"  and  whose  non-existence
       means  "unlocked".   A  value  of  1 says to construct the
       lockname by appending ".lock" to  the  name  of  the  file
       being locked.  A value of 2 says to construct the lockname
       by looking at the device and inode  numbers  of  the  file
       being  locked.   If  the "lockldir" variable is not speci-
       fied, lock files will be created in  the  directory  where
       the file being locked resides.  Otherwise, lock files will
       be created  in  the  directory  specified  by  "lockldir".
       Prior to installing _M_H, you should see how locking is done
       at your site, and set the appropriate values.
