       _R_e_p_l aids a user in producing a reply to an existing  mes-
       sage.   _R_e_p_l  uses  a  reply template to guide its actions
       when constructing the message draft of the reply.  In  its
       simplest  form  (with no arguments), it will set up a mes-
       sage-form skeleton in reply to the current message in  the
       current folder, and invoke the whatnow shell.  The default
       reply template will direct _r_e_p_l to construct the  composed
       message as follows:

          To: <Reply-To> or <From>
          cc: <cc>, <To>, and yourself
          Subject: Re: <Subject>
          In-reply-to: Your message of <Date>.
                       <Message-Id>

     where  field names enclosed in angle brackets (< >) indicate
     the contents of the named field from the  message  to  which
     the  reply is being made.  A reply template is simply a for-
     mat file.  See _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) for the details.

     The `-cc type' switch takes an argument which specifies  who
     gets  placed  on  the "cc:" list of the reply.  The `-query'
     switch modifies the action of `-cc type' switch by  interac-
     tively  asking  you  if  each address that normally would be
     placed in the "To:" and "cc:" list should actually be sent a
     copy.   (This  is useful for special-purpose replies.)  Note
     that the position of the `-cc' and  `-nocc'  switches,  like
     all  other switches which take a positive and negative form,
     is important.

     Lines beginning with the fields  "To:",  "cc:",  and  "Bcc:"
     will  be  standardized and have duplicate addresses removed.
     In addition, the `-width columns' switch will  guide  _r_e_p_l's
     formatting of these fields.

     If the file named "replcomps" exists in the user's MH direc-
     tory, it will be used  instead  of  the  default  form.   In

REPL(1)                BSD Reference Manual               REPL(1)


     either  case, the file specified by `-form formfile' will be
     used if given.

     If the draft already exists, _r_e_p_l will ask  you  as  to  the
     disposition  of the draft.  A reply of qquuiitt will abort _r_e_p_l,
     leaving the draft intact; rreeppllaaccee will replace the  existing
     draft  with  a  blank  skeleton;  and  lliisstt will display the
     draft.

     See  _c_o_m_p (1)  for  a  description  of  the  `-editor'   and
     `-noedit' switches.  Note that while in the editor, the mes-
     sage being replied to is available through a link named  "@"
     (assuming  the  default  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c ).   In  addition,  the
     actual pathname of the message is stored in  the  envariable
     $$eeddiittaalltt, and the pathname of the folder containing the mes-
     sage is stored in the envariable $$mmhhffoollddeerr.

     Although _r_e_p_l uses the `-form formfile' switch to direct  it
     how   to   construct   the   beginning  of  the  draft,  the
     `-filter filterfile' switch directs _r_e_p_l as to how the  mes-
     sage being replied-to should be formatted in the body of the
     draft.  If `-filter' is  not  specified,  then  the  message
     being  replied-to  is not included in the body of the draft.
     If `-filter filterfile' is specified, then the message being
     replied-to  is filtered (re-formatted) prior to being output
     to the body of the draft.  The filter file for  _r_e_p_l  should
     be  a standard form file for _m_h_l, as _r_e_p_l will invoke _m_h_l to
     format the message being replied-to.  There  is  no  default
     message  filter (`-filter' must be followed by a file name).
     A filter file that is commonly used is:

          :
          body:nocomponent,compwidth=9,offset=9

     which says to output a blank line and then the body  of  the
     message being replied-to, indented by one tab-stop.  Another
     format popular on USENET is:


          message-id:nocomponent,nonewline,\
          formatfield="In message %{text}, "
          from:nocomponent,formatfield="%(friendly{text}) writes:"
          body:component=">",overflowtext=">",overflowoffset=0

     Which cites the Message-ID and author of the  message  being
     replied-to,  and then outputs each line of the body prefaced
     with the ">" character.

     If the  `-annotate'  switch  is  given,  the  message  being
     replied-to will be annotated with the lines

          Replied: date
          Replied: addrs

     where the address list contains one line for each addressee.
     The annotation will be done only  if  the  message  is  sent
     directly  from _r_e_p_l.  If the message is not sent immediately
     from _r_e_p_l, "comp -use" may be used to re-edit and  send  the
     constructed  message,  but the annotations won't take place.
     The `-inplace' switch causes annotation to be done in  place
     in order to preserve links to the annotated message.

     The `-fcc +folder' switch can be used to automatically spec-
     ify a folder to receive Fcc:s.  More than one  folder,  each
     preceeded by `-fcc' can be named.

     In addition to the standard _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) escapes, _r_e_p_l also
     recognizes the following additional _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t escape:

     _E_s_c_a_p_e  _R_e_t_u_r_n_s  _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
     _f_c_c     string   Any folders specified with `-fcc folder'

     To avoid reiteration, _r_e_p_l strips any leading `Re: ' strings
     from the _s_u_b_j_e_c_t component.

     The  `-draftfolder +folder' and `-draftmessage msg' switches
     invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This  is  an  advanced
     (and  highly useful) feature.  Consult the AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess
     section of the _M_H manual for more information.

     Upon exiting from the editor, _r_e_p_l will invoke  the  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
     program.   See  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w (1)  for  a  discussion of available
     options.  The invocation of this program can be inhibited by
     using the `-nowhatnowproc' switch.  (In truth of fact, it is
     the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program which starts the initial  edit.   Hence,
     `-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from occurring.)

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       Prior  to  using  the format string mechanism, `-noformat'
       used to cause address headers to be output as-is.  Now all
       address  fields  are  formatted  using  Internet  standard
       guidelines.

BBUUGGSS
       If any addresses occur in the reply template, addresses in
       the  template  that  do  not  contain  hosts are defaulted
       incorrectly.  Instead  of  using  the  localhost  for  the
       default, _r_e_p_l uses the sender's host.  Moral of the story:
       if you're going to include addresses in a reply  template,
       include the host portion of the address.

       The  `-width  columns'  switch is only used to do address-
       folding; other headers are not line-wrapped.

       If _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c is _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, then _r_e_p_l uses a built-in _w_h_a_t_-
       _n_o_w, it does not actually run the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program.  Hence,
       if you define your own _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c, don't call it  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       since _r_e_p_l won't run it.

       If  your  current  working  directory is not writable, the
       link named "@" is not available.
