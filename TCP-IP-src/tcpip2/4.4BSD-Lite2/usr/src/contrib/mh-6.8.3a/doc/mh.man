DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _M_H  is  the  name  of  a powerful message handling system.
       Rather then being a single comprehensive program, _M_H  con-
       sists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose pro-
       grams to send, receive, save, and retrieve messages.   The
       user  should  refer  to the _M_H _U_s_e_r_'_s _M_a_n_u_a_l and the pages
       for the _M_H programs in the Unix Programmers Manual.

       Unlike _m_a_i_l, the standard UNIX mail  user  interface  pro-
       gram,  _M_H  is not a closed system which must be explicitly
       run, then exited when you wish to  return  to  the  shell.
       You  may  freely  intersperse _M_H commands with other shell
       commands, allowing you to read and answer your mail  while
       you  have  (for  example) a compilation running, or search
       for a file or run programs as needed to find the answer to
       someone's question before answering their mail.

       The  rest  of  this manual entry is a quick tutorial which
       will teach you the basics of _M_H.  You should read the man-
       ual entries for the individual programs for complete docu-
       mentation.

       To   get   started   using   _M_H,   put    the    directory
       //uussrr//ccoonnttrriibb//mmhh--66..88//bbiinn  on your $$PPAATTHH.  This is best done
       in one of the files: ..pprrooffiillee, ..llooggiinn, or ..ccsshhrrcc  in  your
       home directory.  (Check the manual entry for the shell you
       use, in case you don't know how to do this.)  Run the  _i_n_c
       command.   If  you've never used _M_H before, it will create
       the necessary default files and directories  after  asking
       you if you wish it to do so.

       _i_n_c  moves  mail  from  your  system maildrop into your _M_H
       `+inbox' folder, breaking it up into  separate  files  and
       converting it to _M_H format as it goes.  It prints one line
       for each message it processes, containing the from  field,
       the  subject  field  and  as much of the first line of the
       message as will fit.  It leaves the first message it  pro-
       cesses  as  your  current message.  You'll need to run _i_n_c
       each time you wish to incorporate new mail  into  your  _M_H
       file.

       _s_c_a_n prints a list of the messages in your current folder.

       The commands: _s_h_o_w, _n_e_x_t, and _p_r_e_v are used to  read  spe-
       cific messages from the current folder.  _s_h_o_w displays the

MH(1)                  BSD Reference Manual                 MH(1)


       current message, or a specific message, which may be spec-
       ified  by  its  number,  which  you pass as an argument to
       _s_h_o_w.  _n_e_x_t and _p_r_e_v display,  respectively,  the  message
       numerically  after  or before the current message.  In all
       cases, the message displayed becomes the current  message.
       If there is no current message, _s_h_o_w may be called with an
       argument, or _n_e_x_t may be used to advance to the first mes-
       sage.

       _r_m_m  (remove message) deletes the current message.  It may
       be called with message numbers  passed  as  arguments,  to
       delete specific messages.

       _r_e_p_l  is  used  to  respond  to  the  current  message (by
       default).  It places you in the editor  with  a  prototype
       response form.  While you're in the editor, you may peruse
       the item you're responding  to  by  reading  the  file  @@.
       After  completing your response, type ll to review it, or ss
       to send it.

       _c_o_m_p allows you to compose a message by putting you in the
       editor on a prototype message form, and then lets you send
       it.

       All the _M_H commands may be run with the  single  argument:
       `-help',  which  causes  them to print a list of the argu-
       ments they may be invoked with.

       Commands which take a message number as an argument (_s_c_a_n,
       _s_h_o_w, _r_e_p_l, ...)  also take one of the words: _f_i_r_s_t, _p_r_e_v,
       _c_u_r, _n_e_x_t, or _l_a_s_t to indicate (respectively)  the  first,
       previous,  current,  next,  or last message in the current
       folder (assuming they are defined).

       Commands which take a range of message numbers (_r_m_m, _s_c_a_n,
       _s_h_o_w, ...)  also take any of the abbreviations:

         _<_n_u_m_1_>_-_<_n_u_m_2_>  -  Indicates  all  messages  in the range
            <num1>  to  <num2>,  inclusive.  The  range  mmuusstt  be
            nonempty.

         _<_n_u_m_>_:_+_N
         _<_n_u_m_>_:_-_N  -  Up  to _N messages beginning with (or ending
            with) message _n_u_m_.  _N_u_m may be any of the pre-defined
            symbols: _f_i_r_s_t_, _p_r_e_v_, _c_u_r_, _n_e_x_t or _l_a_s_t_.

         _f_i_r_s_t_:_N
         _p_r_e_v_:_N
         _n_e_x_t_:_N
         _l_a_s_t_:_N  -  The first, previous, next or last _N messages,
            if they exist.

       If problems are encountered with an _M_H program, the  prob-
       lems  should  be  reported to the local maintainers of _M_H.
       When doing  this,  the  name  of  the  program  should  be
       reported,  along with the version information for the pro-
       gram.
       To find out what version of an _M_H program  is  being  run,
       invoke  the  program with the `-help' switch.  In addition
       to listing the syntax of the  command,  the  program  will
       list information pertaining to its version.  This informa-
       tion includes the version of _M_H, the host it was generated
       on, and the date the program was loaded.  A second line of
       information, found on versions of _M_H after #5.380  include
       _M_H configuration options.  For example,

            version: MH 6.1 #1[UCI] (glacier) of Wed Nov  6 01:13:53 PST 1985
            options: [BSD42] [MHE] [NETWORK] [SENDMTS] [MMDFII] [SMTP] [POP]

       The  `6.1  #1[UCI]' indicates that the program is from the
       UCI _M_H_._6_._1 version of _M_H.  The program  was  generated  on
       the  host  `glacier'  on  `Wed  Nov  6 01:13:53 PST 1985'.
       It's usually a good idea to send the output of the `-help'
       switch along with your report.

       If  there  is no local _M_H maintainer, try the address BBuugg--
       MMHH.   If  that  fails,  use  the  Internet  mailbox   BBuugg--
