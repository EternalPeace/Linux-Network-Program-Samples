       _S_c_a_n produces a one-line-per-message listing of the speci-
       fied messages.  Each _s_c_a_n line contains the message number
       (name), the date, the "From:" field, the "Subject"  field,
       and, if room allows, some of the body of the message.  For
       example:

            15+  7/ 5  Dcrocker  nned  Last week I asked some of
            16 - 7/ 5  dcrocker  message id format  I recommend
            18   7/ 6  Obrien    Re: Exit status from mkdir
            19   7/ 7  Obrien    "scan" listing format in MH

       The `+' on message 15 indicates that  it  is  the  current
       message.  The `-' on message 16 indicates that it has been
       replied to, as indicated by a  "Replied:"  component  pro-
       duced by an `-annotate' switch to the _r_e_p_l command.

       If  there  is  sufficient room left on the _s_c_a_n line after
       the subject, the line will be filled with  text  from  the
       body,  preceded by <<, and terminated by >> if the body is
       sufficiently short.  _S_c_a_n actually reads each of the spec-
       ified  messages  and  parses  them  to extract the desired
       fields.  During parsing, appropriate error  messages  will
       be  produced if there are format errors in any of the mes-
       sages.

       The `-header' switch produces a header line prior  to  the
       _s_c_a_n  listing.   Currently, the name of the folder and the
       current date and time are output (see the HHIISSTTOORRYY  section
       for more information).

       If  the  `-clear'  switch  is  used  and  _s_c_a_n_'_s output is
       directed to a terminal, then _s_c_a_n will consult  the  $$TTEERRMM
       and  $$TTEERRMMCCAAPP  envariables to determine your terminal type
       in order to find out how to  clear  the  screen  prior  to
       exiting.  If the `-clear' switch is used and _s_c_a_n_'_s output
       is not directed to a terminal (e.g., a pipe  or  a  file),
       then _s_c_a_n will send a formfeed prior to exiting.

       For example, the command:

            (scan -clear -header; show all -show pr -f) | lpr

       produces a scan listing of the current folder, followed by
       a formfeed, followed by a formatted listing  of  all  mes-
       sages in the folder, one per page.  Omitting `-show pr -f'
       will cause the messages to be concatenated, separated by a
       one-line header and two blank lines.

       If  _s_c_a_n  encounters  a  message  without a "Date:" field,
       rather than leaving  that  portion  of  the  scan  listing
       blank,  the  date is filled-in with the last write date of
       the message, and post-fixed with a `*'.  This is  particu-
       larly handy for scanning a _d_r_a_f_t _f_o_l_d_e_r, as message drafts
       usually aren't allowed to have dates in them.

       To  override  the  output  format  used   by   _s_c_a_n,   the
       `-format string'  or `-form file' switches are used.  This
       permits individual  fields  of  the  scan  listing  to  be
       extracted with ease.  The string is simply a format string
       and the file is simply a format file.   See  _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5)
       for   the   details.    In   addition   to   the  standard
       _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) escapes, _s_c_a_n also recognizes the  following
       additional _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t escapes:

       _E_s_c_a_p_e    _R_e_t_u_r_n_s  _D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
       body      string   the (compressed) first part of the body
       dtimenow  date     the current date
       folder    string   the name of the current folder

       Also,  if  no  date header was present in the message, the
       _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n escapes which operate on {_d_a_t_e} will return  val-
       ues  for the date of last modification of the message file
       itself.

       _s_c_a_n will update the _M_H  context  prior  to  starting  the
       listing, so interrupting a long _s_c_a_n listing preserves the
       new context.  _M_H purists hate this idea.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       Prior to using the format string mechanism, `-header' used
       to generate a heading saying what each column in the list-
       ing was.  Format strings prevent this from happening.

BBUUGGSS
       The argument to the `-format' switch must  be  interpreted
       as  a single token by the shell that invokes _s_c_a_n.  There-
       fore, one must usually place the argument to  this  switch
       inside double-quotes.
       The  value  of each _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t escape is set by _s_c_a_n to the
       contents of the first message header _s_c_a_n encounters  with
       the  corresponding  component  name; any following headers
       with the same component name are ignored.

       The switch `-reverse', makes _s_c_a_n  list  the  messages  in
       reverse order; this should be considered a bug.

       The  `-file  filename'  switch allows the user to obtain a
       _s_c_a_n listing of a maildrop  file  as  produced  by  _p_a_c_k_f.
       This listing includes every message in the file.  The user
       should use _m_s_h for more selective processing of the  file.
       `-reverse' is ignored with this option.
