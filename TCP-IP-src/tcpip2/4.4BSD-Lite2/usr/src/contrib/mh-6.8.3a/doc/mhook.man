       A receive-mail hook is a program that is run whenever  you
       receive  a mail message.  You do NNOOTT invoke the hook your-
       self, rather the hook is invoked on your  behalf  by  your
       system's  Message  Transport  Agent.   See  _s_l_o_c_a_l (1) for
       details on how to activate receive-mail hooks on your sys-
       tem.

       Four  programs  are  currently  available  as  part of _M_H,
       _r_c_v_d_i_s_t  (redistribute  incoming  messages  to  additional
       recipients),  _r_c_v_p_a_c_k (save incoming messages in a _p_a_c_k_f'd
       file), and _r_c_v_t_t_y (notify user of incoming messages).  The
       fourth  program,  _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e (1)  is  described  separately.
       They all reside in the _/_u_s_r_/_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_/_m_h_-_6_._8_/_l_i_b_/ directory.

       The  _r_c_v_d_i_s_t  program will resend a copy of the message to
       all of the addresses listed on its command line.  It  uses
       the format string facility described in _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5).

       The  _r_c_v_p_a_c_k  program will append a copy of the message to
       the file listed on its command line.  Its use is obsoleted
       by the "file" action of _s_l_o_c_a_l.

       The  _r_c_v_t_t_y  program executes the named file with the mes-
       sage as its standard input, and writes the resulting  out-
       put on your terminal.

       If  no  file  is specified, or is bogus, etc., then _r_c_v_t_t_y
       will instead write a one-line scan  listing.   Either  the
       `-form formatfile'  or `-format string' option may be used
       to override the default output format (see _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5)).
       A  newline  is  output  before the message output, and the
       terminal bell is rung after the output.  The  `-nonewline'
       and `-nobell' options will inhibit these functions.

       In  addition to the standard _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) escapes, _r_c_v_t_t_y
       also  recognizes  the   following   additional   _c_o_m_p_o_n_e_n_t
       escapes:

       Normally,  _r_c_v_t_t_y  obeys  write  permission  as granted by
       _m_e_s_g (1).  With the `-biff' option, _r_c_v_t_t_y will  obey  the
       notification  status set by _b_i_f_f (1) instead.  If the ter-
       minal access daemon (TTYD) is available  on  your  system,
       then  _r_c_v_t_t_y will give its output to the daemon for output
       instead of writing on the user's terminal.
