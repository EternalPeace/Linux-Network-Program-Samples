       _D_p is a program that parses dates according  to  the  ARPA
       Internet  standard.  It also understands many non-standard
       formats, such as those produced by TOPS-20 sites and  some
       UNIX  sites  using _c_t_i_m_e (3).  It is useful for seeing how
       _M_H will interpret a date.

       The _d_p program treats each argument as a single date,  and
       prints the date out in the official 822-format.  Hence, it
       is usually best to enclose each argument in  double-quotes
       for the shell.

       To   override   the   output   format   used  by  _d_p,  the
       `-format string'  or  `-format file'  switches  are  used.
       This  permits  individual  fields  of  the  address  to be
       extracted with  ease.   The  string  is  simply  a  format
       stringand   thefile   is   simply   a  format  file.   See
       _m_h_-_f_o_r_m_a_t (5) for the details.

       Here is the default format string used by _d_p:

            %<(nodate{text})error: %{text}%|%(putstr(pretty{text}))%>

       which says that if an error was detected, print the error,
       a  `:',  and  the  date  in  error.  Otherwise, output the
       822-proper format of the date.

       The  argument  to the `-format' switch must be interpreted
       as a single token by the shell that  invokes  _d_p.   There-
       fore,  one  must usually place the argument to this switch
       inside double-quotes.
