       mhpath - print full pathnames of MH messages and folders

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       mhpath [+folder] [msgs] [-help]

       _M_h_p_a_t_h  expands  and  sorts  the  message  list `msgs' and
       writes the full pathnames of the messages to the  standard
       output separated by newlines.  If no `msgs' are specified,
       _m_h_p_a_t_h outputs the folder pathname instead.  If  the  only
       argument  is `+', your MH _P_a_t_h is output; this can be use-
       ful is shell scripts.

       Contrasted with other MH commands, a message  argument  to
       _m_h_p_a_t_h  may  often  be  intended  for _w_r_i_t_i_n_g.  Because of
       this:

       1) the name "new" has  been  added  to  _m_h_p_a_t_h's  list  of
       reserved  message  names  (the others are "first", "last",
       "prev", "next", "cur", and "all").   The  new  message  is
       equivalent  to  the  message  after  the last message in a
       folder (and equivalent to 1 in a folder without messages).
       The  "new"  message  may  not be used as part of a message
       range.

       2) Within a message list, the following  designations  may
       refer to messages that do not exist: a single numeric mes-
       sage name, the single message name "cur", and  (obviously)
       the single message name "new".  All other message designa-
       tions must refer to at least one existing message.

       3) An empty folder is not in itself an error.

       Message numbers greater than the highest existing  message
       in  a  folder  as part of a range designation are replaced
       with the next free message number.

       Examples: The current folder foo contains messages 3 5  6.
       Cur is 4.

            % mhpath last-new
            bad message list "last-new".

            % mhpath cur
            /r/phyl/Mail/foo/4

            % mhpath 1-2
            no messages in range "1-2".

       _M_H_p_a_t_h is also useful in back-quoted operations:

            % cd `mhpath +inbox`

            % echo `mhpath +`
            /r/phyl/Mail

BBUUGGSS
       Like all MH commands, _m_h_p_a_t_h expands and sorts [msgs].  So
       don't expect

            mv `mhpath 501 500`

       to move 501 to 500.  Quite the reverse.  But

            mv `mhpath 501` `mhpath 500`

       will do the trick.

       Out of range message 0 is treated far more  severely  than
       large out of range message numbers.
