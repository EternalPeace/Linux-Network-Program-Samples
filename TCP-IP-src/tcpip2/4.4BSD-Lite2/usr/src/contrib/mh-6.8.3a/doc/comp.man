       _C_o_m_p  is  used  to  create a new message to be mailed.  It
       copies a message form to the draft being composed and then
       invokes an editor on the draft (unless `-noedit' is given,
       in which case the initial edit is suppressed).

       The default message form contains the following elements:

            To:
            cc:
            Subject:
            --------

       If the file named "components" exists  in  the  user's  MH
       directory, it will be used instead of this form.  The file
       specified by `-form formfile' will be used if given.   You
       may also start _c_o_m_p using the contents of an existing mes-
       sage as the form.  If you supply  either  a  `+folder'  or
       `msg'  argument,  that  message  will be used as the form.
       You may not supply both a `-form formfile' and a `+folder'
       or  `msg'  argument.   The  line of dashes or a blank line
       must be left between the header and the body of  the  mes-
       sage  for the message to be identified properly when it is
       sent (see _s_e_n_d (1)).  The switch `-use'  directs  _c_o_m_p  to
       continue  editing an already started message.  That is, if
       a _c_o_m_p (or _d_i_s_t, _r_e_p_l, or  _f_o_r_w )  is  terminated  without
       sending  the  draft,  the  draft  can  be edited again via
       "comp -use".

       If the draft already exists, _c_o_m_p will ask you as  to  the
       disposition  of  the  draft.   A  reply of qquuiitt will abort
       _c_o_m_p, leaving the draft intact; rreeppllaaccee will  replace  the
       existing  draft  with the appropriate form; lliisstt will dis-
       play the draft; uussee will use the draft for further  compo-
       sition;  and  rreeffiillee ++ffoollddeerr  will  file  the draft in the
       given folder, and give you a new draft with the  appropri-
       ate form.  (The `+folder' argument to rreeffiillee is required.)

       The   `-draftfolder +folder'    and    `-draftmessage msg'
       switches  invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This is an
       advanced  (and  highly  useful)  feature.    Consult   the

       AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess section of the _M_H manual for more infor-
       mation.

       The `-file file' switch says to use the named file as  the
       message draft.

       The  `-editor editor'  switch  indicates the editor to use
       for the initial edit.  Upon exiting from the editor,  _c_o_m_p
       will  invoke  the  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program.  See _w_h_a_t_n_o_w (1) for a
       discussion of available options.  The invocation  of  this
       program  can  be  inhibited  by using the `-nowhatnowproc'
       switch.  (In truth of fact,  it  is  the  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w  program
       which  starts  the  initial edit.  Hence, `-nowhatnowproc'
       will prevent any edit from occurring.)

       If _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c is _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, then _c_o_m_p uses a built-in _w_h_a_t_-
       _n_o_w, it does not actually run the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program.  Hence,
       if  you define your own _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c, don't call it _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       since _c_o_m_p won't run it.
