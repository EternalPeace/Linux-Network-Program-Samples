       _b_b_c  is  a BBoard reading/checking program that interfaces
       to the BBoard channel.

       The _b_b_c program has three action switches which direct its
       operation:

       The  `-read'  switch  invokes the _m_s_h program on the named
       _B_B_o_a_r_d_s.  If you also specify the `-archive' switch,  then
       _b_b_c  will  invoke  the  _m_s_h program on the archives of the
       named _B_B_o_a_r_d_s.  If no _B_B_o_a_r_d_s are  given  on  the  command
       line, and you specified `-archive', _b_b_c will not read your
       `bboards' profile entry, but will read the archives of the
       "system" _B_B_o_a_r_d instead.

       The  `-check'  switch types out status information for the
       named _B_B_o_a_r_d_s.  _b_b_c can  print  one  of  several  messages
       depending  on the status of both the BBoard and the user's
       reading habits.  As with each of these messages, the  num-
       ber  given  is  the item number of the last item placed in
       the BBoard.  This number (which is marked in the  messages
       as  the  "BBoard-Id") is ever increasing.  Hence, when _b_b_c
       says "n items", it really means that the highest BBoard-Id
       is  "n".   There  may, or may not actually be "n" items in
       the BBoard.  Some common messages are:

            BBBBooaarrdd ---- nn iitteemmss uunnsseeeenn
                 This message tells how many items the  user  has
                 not  yet  seen.   When invoked with the `-quiet'
                 switch, this is the only informative  line  that
                 _b_b_c will possibly print out.

            BBBBooaarrdd ---- eemmppttyy
                 The BBoard is empty.

            BBBBooaarrdd ---- nn iitteemmss ((nnoonnee sseeeenn))
                 The  BBoard has items in it, but the user hasn't
                 seen any.

            BBBBooaarrdd ---- nn iitteemmss ((aallll sseeeenn))
                 The BBoard is non-empty, and the user  has  seen

                 everything in it.

            BBBBooaarrdd ---- nn iitteemmss sseeeenn oouutt ooff mm
                 The  BBoard  has at most m-n items that the user
                 has not seen.

       The `-topics' switch directs  _b_b_c  to  print  three  items
       about the named _B_B_o_a_r_d_s: it's official name, the number of
       items present, and the date and time of the  last  update.
       If  no _B_B_o_a_r_d_s are named, then all BBoards are listed.  If
       the `-verbose' switch is given, more information  is  out-
       put.

       The `-quiet' switch specifies that _b_b_c should be silent if
       no _B_B_o_a_r_d_s are found with new information.  The `-verbose'
       switch  specifies that _b_b_c is to consider you to be inter-
       ested in _B_B_o_a_r_d_s that you've already seen everything in.

       To override the default _m_s_h_p_r_o_c and the profile entry, use
       the  `-mshproc program'  switch.  Any arguments not under-
       stood by _b_b_c are passed to this program.  The  `-protocol'
       switch tells _b_b_c that your _m_s_h_p_r_o_c knows about the special
       _b_b_c protocol for reporting back information.  _m_s_h (1), the
       default _m_s_h_p_r_o_c, knows all about this.

       The   `-file BBoardsfile'   switch  tells  _b_b_c  to  use  a
       non-standard _B_B_o_a_r_d_s file  when  performing  its  calcula-
       tions.   Similarly,  the  `-user BBoardsuser' switch tells
       _b_b_c  to  use  a  non-standard  username.   Both  of  these
       switches  are  useful  for  debugging a new _B_B_o_a_r_d_s or _P_O_P
       file.

       If the local host is configured as an NNTP BBoards client,
       or  if  the  `-host host'  switch  is given, then _b_b_c will
       query the NNTP service  host  as  to  the  status  of  the
       BBoards.   For  NNTP BBoards clients, the `-user user' and
       the `-rpop' switches are ignored.

       The _._b_b_r_c file in the user's $$HHOOMMEE directory  is  used  to
       keep   track   of  what  messages  have  been  read.   The
       `-rcfile rcfile' switch overrides the  use  of  _._b_b_r_c  for
       this  purpose.   If  the  value given to the switch is not
       absolute, (i.e., does not begin with a  // ),  it  will  be
       presumed  to start from the current working directory.  If
       this switch is not given (or  the  `-norcfile'  switch  is
       given), then _b_b_c consults the envariable $$MMHHBBBBRRCC, and hon-
       ors it similarly.
