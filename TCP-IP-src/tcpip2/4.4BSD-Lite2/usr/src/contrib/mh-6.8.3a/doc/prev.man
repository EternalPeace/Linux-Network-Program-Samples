       _P_r_e_v performs a _s_h_o_w on the previous message in the speci-
       fied  (or  current)  folder.   Like  _s_h_o_w,  it  passes any
       switches on to the program named  by  _s_h_o_w_p_r_o_c,  which  is
       called  to  list  the  message.   This  command  is almost
       exactly equivalent to "show  prev".   Consult  the  manual
       entry for _s_h_o_w (1) for all the details.

       If  a  folder  is  specified,  it  will become the current
       folder.  The message that is  shown  (i.e.,  the  previous
       message in sequence) will become the current message.

BBUUGGSS
       _p_r_e_v  is  really a link to the _s_h_o_w program.  As a result,
       if you make a link to _p_r_e_v and that  link  is  not  called
       _p_r_e_v, your link will act like _s_h_o_w instead.  To circumvent
       this, add a profile-entry for the link to your _M_H  profile
       and add the argument _p_r_e_v to the entry.
