       _P_o_s_t is the program called by _s_e_n_d (1) to deliver the mes-
       sage in _f_i_l_e to local and remote users.  In fact,  all  of
       the  functions  attributed  to _s_e_n_d on its manual page are
       performed by _p_o_s_t, with _s_e_n_d acting as a relatively simple
       preprocessor.   Thus,  it is _p_o_s_t which parses the various
       header fields, appends From: and Date: lines,  and  inter-
       acts  with  the  _S_e_n_d_M_a_i_l transport system.  _P_o_s_t will not
       normally be called directly by the user.

       _P_o_s_t  searches  the  "To:",  "cc:",  "Bcc:",  "Fcc:",  and
       "Resent-xxx:"  header  lines  of the specified message for
       destination addresses, checks these addresses  for  valid-
       ity, and formats them so as to conform to ARPAnet Internet
       Message Format protocol, unless the  `-noformat'  flag  is
       set.    This  will  normally  cause  "@_l_o_c_a_l_-_s_i_t_e"  to  be
       appended to each local destination address, as well as any
       local  return  addresses.  The `-width columns' switch can
       be used to indicate the preferred  length  of  the  header
       components that contain addresses.

       If  a  "Bcc:"  field is encountered, its addresses will be
       used for delivery, and the "Bcc:" field  will  be  removed
       from  the  message  sent to sighted recipients.  The blind
       recipients will receive an entirely  new  message  with  a
       minimal  set of headers.  Included in the body of the mes-
       sage will be a copy of the message  sent  to  the  sighted
       recipients.   If  `-filter filterfile'  is specified, then
       this copy is filtered (re-formatted) prior to  being  sent
       to the blind recipients.  Otherwise, to use the MIME rules
       for encapsulation, specify the `-mime' switch.

       The `-alias aliasfile' switch can be  used  to  specify  a
       file  that  post  should take aliases from.  More than one
       file can be specified, each being preceded with  `-alias'.
       In any event, the primary alias file is read first.

       The  `-msgid'  switch  indicates  that  a "Message-ID:" or
       "Resent-Message-ID:" field should be added to the  header.

       The  `-verbose'  switch  indicates that the user should be

       informed of each step of the posting/filing process.

       The `-watch' switch indicates that the user would like  to
       watch  the  transport  system's  handling  of  the message
       (e.g., local and "fast" delivery).

       _P_o_s_t consults the envariable $$SSIIGGNNAATTUURREE to  determine  the
       sender's personal name in constructing the "From:" line of
       the message.
