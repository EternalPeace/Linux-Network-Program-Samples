       When  a  user  runs any _M_H program for the first time, the
       program will invoke _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_-_m_h (with the  `-auto'  switch)
       to  query  the  user  for the initial _M_H environment.  The
       user does NNOOTT invoke this program directly.  The  user  is
       asked  for  the  name of the directory that will be desig-
       nated as the user's _M_H directory.  If this directory  does
       not  exist,  the  user  is  asked if it should be created.
       Normally, this directory should be under the  user's  home
       directory,  and  has  the  default  name  of Mail/.  After
       _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_-_m_h has written the  initial  .mh_profile  for  the
       user, control returns to the original _M_H program.

       As  with  all  _M_H  commands, _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_-_m_h first consults the
       $$HHOOMMEE envariable to determine the user's  home  directory.
       If  $$HHOOMMEE  is  not  set, then the _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d file is con-
       sulted.

       When converting from _m_h_._3 to _m_h_._4, _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_-_m_h is automati-
       cally invoked with the `-compat' switch.
