       _R_c_v_s_t_o_r_e  incorporates  a  message from the standard input
       into an _M_H folder.  If `+folder' isn't specified, a folder
       in the user's _M_H directory will be used, either that spec-
       ified by the "Inbox:" entry in the user's profile, or  the
       folder  named "inbox".  The new message being incorporated
       is assigned the next highest number in the folder.  If the
       specified  (or default) folder doesn't exist, then it will
       be created if the `-create' option is specified, otherwise
       _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e will exit.

       If the user's profile contains a "Msg-Protect: nnn" entry,
       it will be used as the protection  on  the  newly  created
       messages,  otherwise  the _M_H default of 0644 will be used.
       During all operations on messages, this initially assigned
       protection will be preserved for each message, so _c_h_m_o_d(1)
       may be used to set a protection on an individual  message,
       and its protection will be preserved thereafter.

       _R_c_v_s_t_o_r_e will incorporate anything except zero length mes-
       sages into the user's MH folder.

       If the profile  entry  "Unseen-Sequence"  is  present  and
       non-empty,  then  _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e will add the newly incorporated
       message to each sequence named by the profile entry.  This
       is  similar  to the "Previous-Sequence" profile entry sup-
       ported by all _M_H commands which take `msgs' or `msg' argu-
       ments.   Note  that  _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e  will not zero each sequence
       prior to adding messages.

       Furthermore, the incoming messages may be added  to  user-
       defined sequences as they arrive by appropriate use of the
       `-sequence' option.  As with _p_i_c_k, use of the `-zero'  and
       `-nozero'  switches can also be used to zero old sequences
       or not.  Similarly, use of the  `-public'  and  `-nopublic
       switches may be used to force additions to public and pri-
       vate sequences.

       No context changes will be attempted, with  the  exception
       of sequence manipulation.

BBUUGGSS
       If  you  use the "Unseen-Sequence" profile entry, _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e
       could try to update the context while another  _M_H  process
       is  also  trying  to do so.  This can cause the context to
       become corrupted.  To avoid this, do not use  _r_c_v_s_t_o_r_e  if
       you use the "Unseen-Sequence" profile entry.
