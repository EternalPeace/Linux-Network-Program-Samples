       _F_o_r_w  may  be  used  to prepare a message containing other
       messages.  It constructs the new message from  the  compo-
       nents  file  or  `-form formfile' (see _c_o_m_p ), with a body
       composed of the message(s) to be forwarded.  An editor  is
       invoked  as  in  _c_o_m_p,  and after editing is complete, the
       user is prompted before the message is sent.

       The default message form contains the following elements:

            To:
            cc:
            Subject:
            --------

       If the file named "forwcomps"  exists  in  the  user's  MH
       directory,  it  will  be  used  instead  of this form.  In
       either case, the file specified by  `-form formfile'  will
       be used if given.

       If  the  draft already exists, _f_o_r_w will ask you as to the
       disposition of the draft.  A  reply  of  qquuiitt  will  abort
       _f_o_r_w,  leaving  the draft intact; rreeppllaaccee will replace the
       existing draft with a blank skeleton; and lliisstt  will  dis-
       play the draft.

       If  the  `-annotate'  switch  is given, each message being
       forwarded will be annotated with the lines

            Forwarded: date
            Forwarded: addrs

       where  each  address  list  contains  as  many  lines   as
       required.   This  annotation will be done only if the mes-
       sage is sent directly from _f_o_r_w.  If the  message  is  not
       sent  immediately  from  _f_o_r_w,  "comp -use" may be used to
       re-edit  and  send  the  constructed  message,   but   the

FORW(1)                BSD Reference Manual               FORW(1)


       annotations  won't  take  place.   The  '-inplace'  switch
       causes annotation to be done in place in order to preserve
       links to the annotated message.

       See  _c_o_m_p (1)  for  a  description  of  the  `-editor' and
       `-noedit' switches.

       Although _f_o_r_w uses the `-form formfile' switch  to  direct
       it  how  to  construct  the  beginning  of  the draft, the
       `-filter filterfile', `-format', and `-noformat'  switches
       direct  _f_o_r_w  as  to  how each forwarded message should be
       formatted in the body of the  draft.   If  `-noformat'  is
       specified,  then  each forwarded message is output exactly
       as it appears.  If `-format'  or  `-filter filterfile'  is
       specified,   then   each  forwarded  message  is  filtered
       (re-formatted) prior to being output to the  body  of  the
       draft.  The filter file for _f_o_r_w should be a standard form
       file for _m_h_l, as _f_o_r_w will invoke _m_h_l to format  the  for-
       warded messages.  The default message filter (what you get
       with `-format') is:

            width=80,overflowtext=,overflowoffset=10
            leftadjust,compress,compwidth=9
            Date:formatfield="%<(nodate{text})%{text}%|%(tws{text})%>"
            From:
            To:
            cc:
            Subject:
            :
            body:nocomponent,overflowoffset=0,noleftadjust,nocompress

       If the file named "mhl.forward" exists in  the  user's  MH
       directory,  it  will  be  used  instead  of this form.  In
       either case, the file  specified  by  `-filter filterfile'
       will  be  used  if  given.  To summarize: `-noformat' will
       reproduce each forwarded message exactly,  `-format'  will
       use _m_h_l and a default filterfile, "mhl.forward", to format
       each forwarded message, and `-filter filterfile' will  use
       the named filterfile to format each forwarded message with
       _m_h_l.

       Each forwarded message is separated with an  encapsulation
       delimiter  and dashes in the first column of the forwarded
       messages  will  be  prepended  with  `- '  so  that   when
       received,   the   message  is  suitable  for  bursting  by
       _b_u_r_s_t (1).  This follows the Internet RFC-934  guidelines.

       For   users  of  _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r (1),  by  specifying  prompter's
       `-prepend' switch in the .mh_profile file, any  commentary
       text  is  entered before the forwarded messages.  (A major
       win!)

       To use the  MIME  rules  for  encapsulation,  specify  the
       `-mime' switch.  This directs _f_o_r_w to generate an _m_h_n com-
       position file.  Note that MH will not invoke _m_h_n automati-
       cally, unless you  add this line to your .mh_profile file:

            automhnproc: mhn

       Otherwise, you must specifically give the command

            What now? edit mhn

       prior to sending the draft.

       To automate this  somewhat,  create  a  link  to  _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r
       called _r_a_p_i_d and put these lines in your .mh_profile file:

            forw: -editor rapid -mime
            rapid: -rapid
            rapid-next: mhn

       Then, you can simply do:

            _f_o_r_w _m_s_g_s
            To: _m_a_i_l_b_o_x
            cc:
            Subject: _w_h_a_t_e_v_e_r

            --------Enter initial text

            _b_l_a_h_, _b_l_a_h_, _b_l_a_h_.
            <CTRL-D>
            --------

            What now? _e_d_i_t
            What now? _s_e_n_d

       The _e_d_i_t command invokes _m_h_n automatically.

       The   `-draftfolder +folder'    and    `-draftmessage msg'
       switches  invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This is an
       advanced  (and  highly  useful)  feature.    Consult   the
       AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess section of the _M_H manual for more infor-
       mation.

       Upon exiting from the editor, _f_o_r_w will invoke the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       program.   See  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w (1)  for a discussion of available
       options.  The invocation of this program can be  inhibited
       by  using the `-nowhatnowproc' switch.  (In truth of fact,
       it is the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program which starts the  initial  edit.
       Hence,  `-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from occur-
       ring.)

       The `-digest list', `-issue number', and  `-volume number'
       switches  implement  a digest facility for _M_H.  Specifying
       these switches  enables  and/or  overloads  the  following
       escapes:

       If _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c is _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, then _f_o_r_w uses a built-in _w_h_a_t_-
       _n_o_w, it does not actually run the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program.  Hence,
       if you define your own _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c, don't call it  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       since _f_o_r_w won't run it.

       When _f_o_r_w is told to annotate the messages it forwards, it
       doesn't actually annotate them until the draft is success-
       fully  sent.  If from the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c, you _p_u_s_h instead of
       _s_e_n_d, it's possible to confuse  _f_o_r_w  by  re-ordering  the
       file (e.g., by using `folder -pack') before the message is
       successfully sent.  _D_i_s_t and _r_e_p_l don't have this problem.

       To  avoid  prepending  the leading dash characters in for-
       warded messages, there is a `-nodashmunging' option.   See
       the  "Hidden  Features"  section of the _M_H _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r_'_s
