       This program is normally not invoked directly by users but
       takes the place  of  an  editor  and  acts  as  an  editor
       front-end.   It  operates  on  an  822-style message draft
       skeleton specified by file,  normally  provided  by  _c_o_m_p,
       _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, or _r_e_p_l.

       _P_r_o_m_p_t_e_r  is  an  editor which allows rapid composition of
       messages.   It  is  particularly  useful  to  network  and
       low-speed  (less than 2400 baud) users of _M_H.  It is an _M_H
       program in that it can have its  own  profile  entry  with
       switches, but it is not invoked directly by the user.  The
       commands _c_o_m_p, _d_i_s_t, _f_o_r_w, and _r_e_p_l invoke _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r as  an
       editor, either when invoked with `-editor prompter', or by
       the profile entry "Editor: prompter", or  when  given  the
       command `edit prompter' at "What now?" level.

       For  each empty component _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r finds in the draft, the
       user is prompted for a response; A <RETURN> will cause the
       whole  component to be left out.  Otherwise, a `\' preced-
       ing a <RETURN> will continue  the  response  on  the  next
       line,  allowing  for  multiline  components.  Continuation
       lines mmuusstt begin with a space or tab.

       Each non-empty component is copied to the draft  and  dis-
       played on the terminal.

       The  start  of the message body is denoted by a blank line
       or a line of  dashes.   If  the  body  is  non-empty,  the
       prompt, which isn't written to the file, is

           "--------Enter additional text",

       or (if `-prepend' was given)

           "--------Enter initial text".

       Message-body  typing  is  terminated  with  an end-of-file
       (usually CTRL-D).  With the `-doteof' switch, a period  on
       a  line all by itself also signifies end-of-file.  At this
       point control is returned to the  calling  program,  where
       the  user is asked "What now?".  See _w_h_a_t_n_o_w for the valid
       options to this query.

       By using the `-prepend' switch, the user can  add  type-in
       to  the beginning of the message body and have the rest of
       the body follow.  This is useful for the _f_o_r_w command.

       By using the `-rapid' switch, if the  draft  already  con-
       tains text in the message-body, it is not displayed on the
       user's terminal.  This is useful for low-speed  terminals.

       The  line  editing  characters  for  kill and erase may be
       specified by the user via the  arguments  `-kill chr'  and
       `-erase chr',  where  chr  may  be a character; or `\nnn',
       where "nnn" is the octal value for the character.

       An interrupt (usually CTRL-C) during component typing will
       abort  _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r  and  the  _M_H command that invoked it.  An
       interrupt during  message-body  typing  is  equivalent  to
       CTRL-D,  for historical reasons.  This means that _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r
       should finish up and exit.

       The first non-flag argument to _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r is  taken  as  the
       name  of the draft file, and subsequent non-flag arguments
       are ignored.

       The `-rapid' option is particularly useful with _f_o_r_w,  and
       `-noprepend' is useful with _c_o_m_p _-_u_s_e.

       The  user  may  wish  to link _p_r_o_m_p_t_e_r under several names
       (e.g., "rapid") and give appropriate switches in the  pro-
       file  entries  under  these names (e.g., "rapid: -rapid").
       This facilitates invoking prompter differently for differ-
       ent _M_H commands (e.g., "forw: -editor rapid").

       _P_r_o_m_p_t_e_r uses _s_t_d_i_o (3), so it will lose if you edit files
       with nulls in them.
