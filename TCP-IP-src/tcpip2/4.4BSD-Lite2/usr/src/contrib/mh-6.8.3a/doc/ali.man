       _A_l_i  searches  the  named mail alias files for each of the
       given _a_l_i_a_s_e_s.  It creates a list of addresses  for  those
       _a_l_i_a_s_e_s,  and writes that list on standard output.  If the
       `-list' option is specified, each  address  appears  on  a
       separate  line;  otherwise, the addresses are separated by
       commas and printed on as few lines as possible.

       The `-user' option directs _a_l_i to perform  its  processing
       in  an  inverted fashion: instead of listing the addresses
       that each given  alias  expands  to,  _a_l_i  will  list  the
       aliases  that expand to each given address.  If the `-nor-
       malize' switch is given, _a_l_i will try to  track  down  the
       official hostname of the address.

       The  files specified by the profile entry "Aliasfile:" and
       any additional alias files given by the `-alias aliasfile'
       switch will be read.  Each _a_l_i_a_s is processed as described
       in _m_h_-_a_l_i_a_s (5).
