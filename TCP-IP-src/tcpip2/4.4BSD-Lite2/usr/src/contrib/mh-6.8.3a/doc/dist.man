       _D_i_s_t  is  similar to _f_o_r_w.  It prepares the specified mes-
       sage for redistribution to addresses that (presumably) are
       not on the original address list.

       The default message form contains the following elements:

            Resent-To:
            Resent-cc:

       If  the  file  named  "distcomps"  exists in the user's MH
       directory, it will be  used  instead  of  this  form.   In
       either  case,  the file specified by `-form formfile' will
       be used if given.  The form used will be prepended to  the
       message being resent.

       If  the  draft already exists, _d_i_s_t will ask you as to the
       disposition of the draft.  A  reply  of  qquuiitt  will  abort
       _d_i_s_t,  leaving  the draft intact; rreeppllaaccee will replace the
       existing draft with a blank skeleton; and lliisstt  will  dis-
       play the draft.

       Only  those  addresses  in "Resent-To:", "Resent-cc:", and
       "Resent-Bcc:" will be sent.  Also, a  "Resent-Fcc: folder"
       will  be honored (see _s_e_n_d (1)).  Note that with _d_i_s_t, the
       draft should contain  only  "Resent-xxx:"  fields  and  no
       body.   The  headers  and the body of the original message
       are copied to the draft when the  message  is  sent.   Use
       care in constructing the headers for the redistribution.

       If  the  `-annotate'  switch  is given, the  message being
       distributed will be annotated with the lines:

            Resent: date
            Resent: addrs

       where  each  address  list  contains  as  many  lines   as
       required.   This  annotation will be done only if the mes-
       sage is sent directly from _d_i_s_t.  If the  message  is  not
       sent  immediately  from  _d_i_s_t,  "comp -use" may be used to
       re-edit  and  send  the  constructed  message,   but   the

       annotations  won't  take  place.   The  '-inplace'  switch
       causes annotation to be done in place in order to preserve
       links to the annotated message.

       See  _c_o_m_p (1)  for  a  description  of  the  `-editor' and
       `-noedit' switches.  Note that while in  the  editor,  the
       message being resent is available through a link named "@"
       (assuming the default  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c ).   In  addition,  the
       actual pathname of the message is stored in the envariable
       $$eeddiittaalltt, and the pathname of the  folder  containing  the
       message is stored in the envariable $$mmhhffoollddeerr.

       The    `-draftfolder +folder'    and   `-draftmessage msg'
       switches invoke the _M_H draft folder facility.  This is  an
       advanced   (and   highly  useful)  feature.   Consult  the
       AAddvvaanncceedd FFeeaattuurreess section of the _M_H manual for more infor-
       mation.

       Upon exiting from the editor, _d_i_s_t will invoke the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       program.  See _w_h_a_t_n_o_w (1) for a  discussion  of  available
       options.   The invocation of this program can be inhibited
       by using the `-nowhatnowproc' switch.  (In truth of  fact,
       it  is  the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program which starts the initial edit.
       Hence, `-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from  occur-
       ring.)

       _D_i_s_t originally used headers of the form "Distribute-xxx:"
       instead  of  "Resent-xxx:".   In order to conform with the
       ARPA Internet standard, RFC-822, the "Resent-xxx:" form is
       now  used.   _D_i_s_t  will  recognize  "Distribute-xxx:" type
       headers and automatically convert them to "Resent-xxx:".

BBUUGGSS
       _D_i_s_t does not _r_i_g_o_r_o_u_s_l_y  check  the  message  being  dis-
       tributed for adherence to the transport standard, but _p_o_s_t
       called by _s_e_n_d does.  The  _p_o_s_t  program  will  balk  (and
       rightly  so)  at poorly formatted messages, and _d_i_s_t won't
       correct things for you.

       If _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c is _w_h_a_t_n_o_w, then _d_i_s_t uses a built-in _w_h_a_t_-
       _n_o_w, it does not actually run the _w_h_a_t_n_o_w program.  Hence,
       if you define your own _w_h_a_t_n_o_w_p_r_o_c, don't call it  _w_h_a_t_n_o_w
       since _d_i_s_t won't run it.

       If  your  current  working  directory is not writable, the
       link named "@" is not available.
