       Since  the _M_H environment is the shell, it is easy to lose
       track of the current folder from day to day.  When  _f_o_l_d_e_r
       is  given  the  `-print' switch (the default), _f_o_l_d_e_r will
       list the current folder, the number of messages in it, the
       range  of the messages (low-high), and the current message
       within the folder, and  will  flag  extra  files  if  they
       exist.  An example of this summary is:

       inbox+            has  16 messages (  3- 22); cur=  5.

       If  a  `+folder'  and/or  `msg'  are  specified, they will
       become the current folder and/or message.  By  comparison,
       when  a `+folder' argument is given, this corresponds to a
       "cd" operation in the _s_h_e_l_l; when no `+folder' argument is
       given,  this  corresponds  roughly to a "pwd" operation in
       the _s_h_e_l_l.

       If the specified (or default) folder  doesn't  exist,  the
       default  action  is  to  query  the user as to whether the
       folder should be created; when standard  input  is  not  a
       tty, the answer to the query is assumed to be "yes".

       Specifying `-create' will cause _f_o_l_d_e_r to create new fold-
       ers without any query.  (This is the easy way to create an
       empty  folder for use later.)  Specifying `-nocreate' will
       cause _f_o_l_d_e_r  to  exit  without  creating  a  non-existant
       folder.

       Specifying  `-all'  will  produce  a summary line for each
       top-level folder in the user's MH directory, sorted alpha-
       betically.   (If  _f_o_l_d_e_r  is invoked by a name ending with
       "s" (e.g.,  _f_o_l_d_e_r_s ),  `-all'  is  assumed).   Specifying
       `-recurse'  with  `-all'  will also produce a line for all
       sub-folders.   These  folders  are  all  preceded  by  the
       read-only  folders,  which  occur as "atr-cur-" entries in
       the user's _M_H context.  For example,

       Folder               # of messages ( range )  cur msg (other files)
       /fsd/rs/m/tacc    has  35 messages (  1- 35); cur= 23.
       /rnd/phyl/Mail/EP has  82 messages (  1-108); cur= 82.
       ff                has  no messages.
       inbox+            has  16 messages (  3- 22); cur=  5.
       mh                has  76 messages (  1- 76); cur= 70.
       notes             has   2 messages (  1-  2); cur=  1.
       ucom              has 124 messages (  1-124); cur=  6; (others).
                 TOTAL=      339 messages in 7 folders

       The "+" after inbox  indicates  that  it  is  the  current
       folder.   The  "(others)" indicates that the folder `ucom'
       has files which aren't messages.  These files  may  either
       be  sub-folders,  or  files that don't belong under the MH
       file naming scheme.

       The header is output if either a  `-all'  or  a  `-header'
       switch  is  specified; it is suppressed by `-noheader'.  A
       `-total' switch will produce only the summary line.

       If `-fast' is given, only the folder name (or names in the
       case  of  `-all') will be listed.  (This is faster because
       the folders need not be read.)

       If a `+folder' is given  along  with  the  `-all'  switch,
       _f_o_l_d_e_r  will,  in  addition to setting the current folder,
       list the top-level folders for the  current  folder  (with
       `-norecurse')  or  list  all sub-folders under the current
       folder recursively (with `-recurse').  In this case, if  a
       `msg' is also supplied, it will become the current message
       of `+folder'.

       The `-recurse' switch lists each  folder  recursively,  so
       use  of this option effectively defeats the speed enhance-
       ment of the `-fast' option,  since  each  folder  must  be
       searched for subfolders.  Nevertheless, the combination of
       these options is useful.

       The `-pack' switch will compress the message names in  the
       designated  folders,  removing holes in message numbering.
       The `-verbose' switch directs _f_o_l_d_e_r to tell the user  the
       general  actions that it is taking to compress the folder.

       The `-push' switch directs  _f_o_l_d_e_r  to  push  the  current
       folder onto the _f_o_l_d_e_r_-_s_t_a_c_k, and make the `+folder' argu-
       ment the current folder.  If `+folder' is not  given,  the
       current  folder  and  the  top  of  the  _f_o_l_d_e_r_-_s_t_a_c_k  are

       exchanged.  This corresponds to the "pushd"  operation  in
       the _C_S_h_e_l_l.

       The `-pop' switch directs _f_o_l_d_e_r to discard the top of the
       _f_o_l_d_e_r_-_s_t_a_c_k, after setting the  current  folder  to  that
       value.   No  `+folder'  argument  is allowed.  This corre-
       sponds to the "popd" operation in the _C_S_h_e_l_l.  The `-push'
       switch  and  the `-pop' switch are mutually exclusive: the
       last occurrence  of  either  one  overrides  any  previous
       occurrence  of the other.  Both of these switches also set
       `-list' by default.

       The `-list' switch directs _f_o_l_d_e_r to list the contents  of
       the  _f_o_l_d_e_r_-_s_t_a_c_k.   No  `+folder'  argument  is  allowed.
       After a successful `-push' or `-pop', the  `-list'  action
       is  taken,  unless  a `-nolist' switch follows them on the
       command line.  This corresponds to the "dirs" operation in
       the  _C_S_h_e_l_l.   The  `-push',  `-pop', and `-list' switches
       turn off `-print'.

       In  previous  versions of _M_H, the `-fast' switch prevented
       context changes from occurring  for  the  current  folder.

       This  is  no  longer the case: if `+folder' is given, then
       _f_o_l_d_e_r will always change the current folder to that.

       `-all' forces `-header' and `-total'.

       There is no way to restore the default  behavior  (to  ask
       the  user  whether  to create a non-existant folder) after
       `-create' or `-nocreate' is given.
