       The  _m_a_r_k  command manipulates message sequences by adding
       or deleting message numbers from  folder-specific  message
       sequences,  or by listing those sequences and messages.  A
       message sequence is  a  keyword,  just  like  one  of  the
       "reserved"  message  names,  such  as  "first"  or "next".
       Unlike the "reserved" message names, which  have  a  fixed
       semantics  on  a per-folder basis, the semantics of a mes-
       sage sequence may be defined, modified, and removed by the
       user.   Message  sequences  are folder-specific, e.g., the
       sequence name "seen" in the  context  of  folder  "+inbox"
       need  not  have any relation whatsoever to the sequence of
       the same name in a folder of a different name.

       Three action switches direct the operation of _m_a_r_k.  These
       switches  are  mutually  exclusive: the last occurrence of
       any of them overrides any previous occurrence of the other
       two.

       The  `-add' switch tells _m_a_r_k to add messages to sequences
       or to create a new sequence.  For each sequence named  via
       the  `-sequence name'  argument (which must occur at least
       once) the messages named via  `msgs'  (which  defaults  to
       "cur"  if no `msgs' are given), are added to the sequence.
       The messages to be added  need  not  be  absent  from  the
       sequence.    If  the  `-zero'  switch  is  specified,  the
       sequence will be emptied prior  to  adding  the  messages.
       Hence,  `-add -zero'  means  that  each sequence should be
       initialized   to    the    indicated    messages,    while
       `-add -nozero' means that each sequence should be appended
       to by the indicated messages.

       The `-delete' switch tells _m_a_r_k to  delete  messages  from
       sequences,  and  is  the  dual of `-add'.  For each of the
       named sequences, the named messages are removed  from  the
       sequence.   These  messages need not be already present in
       the sequence.  If the `-zero' switch  is  specified,  then
       all  messages  in  the folder are appended to the sequence
       prior to removing the  messages.   Hence,  `-delete -zero'
       means  that  each  sequence  should  contain  all messages
       except those indicated, while `-delete -nozero' means that
       only  the  indicated  messages should be removed from each
       sequence.       As       expected,       the       command

       `mark -sequence seen -delete all'   deletes  the  sequence
       "seen" from the current folder.

       When creating (or modifying)  a  sequence,  the  `-public'
       switch indicates that the sequence should be made readable
       for other _M_H users.  In contrast, the  `-nopublic'  switch
       indicates  that  the  sequence  should  be  private to the
       user's _M_H environment.

       The `-list' switch tells _m_a_r_k to list both  the  sequences
       defined  for  the  folder and the messages associated with
       those sequences.  _M_a_r_k will list the name of each sequence
       given by `-sequence name' and the messages associated with
       that sequence.  If `-sequence' isn't used,  all  sequences
       will be listed, with private sequences being so indicated.
       The `-zero'  switch  does  not  affect  the  operation  of
       `-list'.

       The current restrictions on sequences are:

         The  name used to denote a message sequence must consist
         of an alphabetic character  followed  by  zero  or  more
         alphanumeric  characters,  and  cannot  be  one  of  the
         (reserved) message names "new", "first", "last",  "all",
         "next", or "prev".

         Only  a certain number of sequences may be defined for a
         given folder.  This number is usually limited to 26  (10
         on small systems).

         Message  ranges  with  user-defined  sequence  names are
         restricted to the form "name:n" or "name:-n", and  refer
         to  the  first  or  last  `n'  messages  of the sequence
         `name',   respectively.    Constructs   of   the    form
         "name1-name2" are forbidden.
