       rmm - remove messages

       rmm [+folder] [msgs] [-help]

       _R_m_m removes the specified messages by renaming the message
       files with preceding commas.  Many  sites  consider  files
       that  start  with  a  comma  to be a temporary backup, and
       arrange for _c_r_o_n (8) to remove such files once a day.

       If the user has a profile component such as

            rmmproc:  /bin/rm

       then instead of simply renaming the message file, _r_m_m will
       call  the  named program to delete the file.  Note that at
       most installations, _c_r_o_n (8) is told to remove files  that
       begin with a comma once a night.

       Some users of csh prefer the following:

            alias rmm 'refile +d'

       where folder +d is a folder for deleted messages, and

            alias mexp 'rm `mhpath +d all`'

       is used to "expunge" deleted messages.

       The current message is not changed by _r_m_m, so a _n_e_x_t  will
       advance to the next message in the folder as expected.

       Since _r_e_f_i_l_e uses your _r_m_m_p_r_o_c to delete the message,  the
       _r_m_m_p_r_o_c  must  NNOOTT call _r_e_f_i_l_e without specifying `-normm-
       proc', or you will create an infinte loop.
