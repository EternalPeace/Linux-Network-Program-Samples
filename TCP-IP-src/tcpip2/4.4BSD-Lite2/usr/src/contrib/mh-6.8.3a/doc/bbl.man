       _b_b_l allows a _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r to manage a BBoard.  The process  is
       relatively  simple:  a _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r invokes the _b_b_l program to
       set-up an environment in which the messages  contained  in
       the  BBoard may be accessed as if they were messages in an
       _M_H folder.

       To do this, _b_b_l, _i_n_c_s the _B_B_o_a_r_d to the folder "+bbl", and
       _i_n_c_s the archives for the _B_B_o_a_r_d to the folder "+bbl/arc".
       The _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r then gets a new shell in  which  _M_H  commands
       (among  others)  may  be  executed.   When the _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r is
       done, CTRL-D is typed, which terminates  the  shell.   _b_b_l
       then  asks  the  _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r  as  to how the BBoard should be
       reconstructed.   Usually,  this  results  in  zeroing  the
       existing  _B_B_o_a_r_d file, and  _p_a_c_king the "+bbl" folder into
       the _B_B_o_a_r_d  file.   Similar  actions  are  taken  for  the
       archive.

       The `-shell' switch specifies what process that _b_b_l should
       invoke as your command interpreter.  This need  not  be  a
       rooted  filename.   If  this  switch is not specified, _b_b_l
       looks at the envariable  $$SSHHEELLLL  for  a  value.   If  this
       envariable is not set, then _b_b_l uses your login shell.

       The  `-verbose'  switch directs _b_b_l to type the shell com-
       mands that it executes to get the job done (e.g., _c_h_m_o_d s,
       _i_n_c s, etc.)

       As  _b_b_l  processing is most likely not intuitively obvious
       to most prospective BBoard-leaders, a short diatribe is in
       order.  As pointed out in _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r(1), a BBoard-leader (of
       the fictitious BBoard "hacks") has three  primary  mainte-
       nance functions:

       RReeaadd tthhee BBBBooaarrdd
            You don't need _b_b_l to do this, use _b_b_c instead.

       RReemmoovvee iinnaapppprroopprriiaattee mmaatteerriiaall
            Do this by running _b_b_l.  An example of this might be:

            In item 1,  the  BBoard-Leader  invokes  _b_b_l  on  the
            BBoard  called  "hacks".  The _b_b_l program responds by
            typing items 2 and 3 which  tell  the  user  what  _M_H
            folders are being used and that a sub-shell is now in
            use (respectively).  The user does a scan of the +bbl
            folder  (_b_b_l  sets  the  current-folder to be the one
            with the BBoard in it.)  and finds two messages  that
            should be removed (numbers 20 and 21).  The user then
            removes these using the _r_m_m program (item 9) and then
            types  a  CTRL-D to return to _b_b_l (item 10).  At this
            point, _b_b_l asks  how  the  BBoard  should  be  recon-
            structed.   Item  11 asks if the contents of the +bbl
            folder should OVERWRITE the contents of  the  BBoard.
            The  user  responds  `yes', that it should (hence the
            two _r_m_m'd messages disappear).  Next on item 12,  the
            user  is  asked  if the +bbl folder should be killed,
            since the BBoards have been successfully updated, the
            user answers `yes'.  On item 13, the user is asked if
            the archives should be updated.  Since the user  made
            no changes, the answer `no' is made.  (The user could
            have answered `yes' with no disastrous  effects,  but
            knew  that  nothing  had  been updated).  Finally, on
            item 14, the user indicates that  the  +bbl/arc  sub-
            folder should be killed, by answering `yes'.

            The important command given is in item 18,  in  which
            the user _f_i_l_e_s some messages from +bbl into +bbl/arc.
            When CTRL-D is typed, the user directs _b_b_l to  update
            both  the  BBoard  and  its  archives, which does the
            proper action.  As an  alternate  to  this  scenario,
            some creative _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r_s might use the _p_i_c_k command to
            do all of the work:

                 pick -sequence select -before -12 -datefield BB-Posted -zero
                 pick -sequence select -before -20 -nozero
                 scan select
                 refile select +bbl/arc

            In order to facilitate the use  of  automation  shell
            scripts,  if the standard input for _b_b_l is _n_o_t a tty,
            then _b_b_l will not ask any questions and will  proceed
            as  if the user's answer was "yes" for all questions.
            Hence, _b_b_l may be run under _c_r_o_n (8) to  provide  for
            automatic archiving.

       In  the  early days of the UCI BBoards facility, _B_B_l_e_a_d_e_r_s
       actually used to run this program by hand.  Now, this  _b_b_l
       is  often run automatically by the system to perform auto-
       matic archiving.

BBUUGGSS
       Note that _b_b_l executes a lot of _M_H commands, and as  such,
       each  of these commands can and will read your _._m_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e
       for  defaults.   Please   read   the   BBUUGGSS   section   of
       _m_h_-_p_r_o_f_i_l_e (5) for some hints to help you avoid many silly
       problems.

       Also, _b_b_l is unforgiving in doing exactly what it is told,
       so take special care in answering _b_b_l's questions.
