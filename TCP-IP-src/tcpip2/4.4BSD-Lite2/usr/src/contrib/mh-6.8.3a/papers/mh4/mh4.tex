\noindent
This document describes user-visible changes to the
UCI version of the Rand \MH/ system that were made
from \mh3 to \mh4.
In particular,
four facilities are discussed:
multiple composition of drafts,
user-defined sequences,
the folder-stack,
and,
relative folder addressing.
This document does not describe bug-fixes, per se,
or internal changes,
unless these activities resulted in a visible change for the \MH/ user.
\par
This document is meant to supplement,
not supersede, the standard \MH/ user manual\cite{MH}.
\par
Comments concerning this documentation should be addressed to the Internet
mailbox {\sf Bug-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU}.
