This directory contains the TeX style and macro files necessary to
typset the following documents:

mh4		Changes to The Rand MH Message Handling System: MH.4
mh5		Changes to The Rand MH Message Handling System: MH.5
realwork	MH.5: How to process 200 messages a day ...
bboards		The Rand MH Message Handling System: The UCI BBoards Facility
tutorial	The Rand MH Message Handling System: Tutorial
multifarious	MH: A Multifarious User Agent
trusted		Design of the TTI Prototype Trusted Mail Agent

These documents were originally designed to be typset with the AM font
family using UCI PhDTeX, which was AmSTeX with the UCI diss.sty style
preloaded.  Since (not surprisingly) few sites had UCI PhDTeX, diss.sty
was included with the documents.

In the intervening years, AmSTeX has evolved and few sites are still
using the AM font family.  Although some of these documents are
now outdated, some sites may still want to generate and print them.
For this reason, this directory contains all files necessary to typeset
these documents using plain TeX (as of Version 2.991).

The following newer documents are typset using LaTeX; the needed style
and macro files are present in each directory:

beginners	MH for Beginners
mh4mm		MH for MM Users
mh6		Changes to The Rand MH Message Handling System: MH.6
mh6.5		Changes to The Rand MH 
			Message Handling System: MH #6.5 for 4.3BSD UNIX
mznet		MZnet:  Mail Service for Personal Micro-Computer Systems

Updating the older documents to use LaTeX would be possible but tedious,
especially considering how outdated most of the documents are.
