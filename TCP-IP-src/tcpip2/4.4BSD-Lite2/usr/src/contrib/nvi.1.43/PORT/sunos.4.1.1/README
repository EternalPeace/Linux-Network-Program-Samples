SunOS 4.1.X curses is broken.  It occasionally repaints the wrong thing
on the screen, and nobody has been able to figure out a workaround other
than to rewrite curscr every time stdscr is modified.  This, obviously,
trashes performance.  A test program is attached.

/*
 * Compile with: 
 * /usr/5bin/cc -DSYSV_CURSES curse.c -lcurses
 *
 * Broken on: SunOS virtual61 4.1.3C 8 sun4m
 *
 * The broken behavior can be seen in that the line is first displayed,
 * then redisplayed, with a missing the 'r' from the word "different",
 * and then redisplayed correctly.
