.SH DESCRIPTION
Pnews is a friendly interface for posting news articles.
It will ask several questions, then allow you to enter your article,
and then post it using the inews(1) program.
If you type h and a carriage return at any point,
.I Pnews
will tell you what it wants to know.
.PP
The -h form is used when invoked from
.IR rn .
If your editor can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the environment
variable NEWSPOSTER as \*(L"Pnews -h %h %A\*(R".
You can also modify the the NEWSHEADER environment variable to change the
header file that
.I rn
passes to Pnews.
