.SH NAME
newsgroups - a program to list unsubscribed newsgroups.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B newsgroups pattern flag
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I newsgroups
program compares your .newsrc file with the file of active newsgroups,
and prints a list of unsubscribed newsgroups matching pattern.
If the second argument \*(L"flag\*(R" is present, only newsgroups not
found in your .newsrc are listed, and the display is not paged.
If the second argument is missing, the display is paged, and an additional
list of unsubscribed newsgroups occurring in your .newsrc is printed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP DOTDIR 8
Where to find your .newsrc, if not in your home directory.
.Sp
Default: $HOME
.IP HOME 8
Your home directory.
.Sp
Default: $LOGDIR
.IP LOGDIR 8

.SH FILES

.br
${DOTDIR-{$HOME-$LOGDIR}}/.newsrc
