.SH SYNOPSIS

.B Rnmail
.SH DESCRIPTION
Rnmail is a friendly interface for mailing replies to news articles.
It will ask several questions, then allow you to enter your letter,
and then mail it off.
If you type h and a carriage return at any point,
.I Rnmail
will tell you what it wants to know.
.PP
The -h form is used when invoked from
.IR rn .
If your editor can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the environment
variable MAILPOSTER as \*(L"Rnmail -h %h %A\*(R".
You can also modify the the MAILHEADER environment variable to change the
header file that
.I rn
passes to Rnmail.
