.SH NAME
overview.fmt \- format of news overview database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.\" =()<.I @<_PATH_SCHEMA>@>()=
.I /var/spool/news/data/overview.fmt
specifies the organization of the news overview database.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
The order of lines in this file is important; it determines the order
in which the fields will appear in the database.

Most lines will consist of an article header name, optionally
followed by a colon.
A trailing set of lines can have the word ``full'' appear after the
colon; this indicates that the header should appear as well as its value.

If this file is changed, it is usually necessary to rebuild the
existing overview database using
.IR expireover (8)
after removing all existing overview files.
