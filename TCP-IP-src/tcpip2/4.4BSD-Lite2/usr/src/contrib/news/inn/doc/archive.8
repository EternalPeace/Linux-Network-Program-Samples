.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Archive
makes copies of files specified on its standard input.
It is normally run either as a channel feed under
.IR innd (8),
or by a script before
.IR expire (8)
is run.
.PP
.I Archive
reads the named
.I input
file, or standard input if no file is given.
The input is taken as a set of lines.
Blank lines and lines starting with a number sign (``#'') are ignored.
All other lines should specify the name of a file to archive.
If a filename is not an absolute pathname, it is taken to be relative to
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_SPOOL>@ .>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/spool .
.PP
Files are copied to a directory within the archive directory,
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_ARCHIVEDIR>@ .>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/news.archive .
The default is to create a hierarchy that mimics the input files;
intermediate directories will be created as needed.
For example, the input file
.I comp/sources/unix/2211
(article 2211 in the newsgroup comp.sources.unix) will be copied to
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_ARCHIVEDIR>@/comp/sources/unix/2211 .>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/news.archive/comp/sources/unix/2211 .
If the ``\-f'' flag is used, then all directory names will be
flattened out, replacing the slashes with periods.
In this case, the file would be copied to
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_ARCHIVEDIR>@/comp.sources.unix/2211 .>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/news.archive/comp.sources.unix/2211 .
.PP
If the ``\-i'' flag is used, then
.I archive
will append one line to the specified
.I index
file for each article that it copies.
This line will contain the destination name and the Message-ID and
Subject headers.
.PP
For example, a typical
.IR newsfeeds (5)
entry to archive most source newsgroups is as follows:
.RS
.nf
.\" =()<.ds R$ @<_PATH_NEWSBIN>@>()=
.ds R$ /usr/contrib/news
source-archive\e
	:!*,*sources*,!*wanted*,!*.d\e
	:Tc,Wn\e
	:\*(R$/archive \-f \-i \e
	    /usr/spool/news/news.archive/INDEX
.fi
.RE
.PP
Files are copied by making a link.
If that fails a new file is created.
.\" =()<.ie '@<HAVE_SYMLINK>@'DO' \{\>()=
.ie 'DO'DO' \{\
If the ``\-m'' flag is used, then the file will be copied to the
destination, and the input file will be replaced with a symbolic
link pointing to the new file.\}
.el \{\
The ``\-m'' flag is ignored.\}
.PP
By default,
.I archive
sets its standard error to
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_ERRLOG>@ .>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/data/errlog .
To suppress this redirection, use the ``\-r'' flag.
.PP
If the input is exhausted,
.I archive
will exit with a zero status.
If an I/O error occures, it will try to spool its input, copying it to a file.
If there was no input filename, the standard input will be copied to
.\" =()<.I @<_PATH_BATCHDIR>@/archive>()=
.I /var/spool/news/out.going/archive
and the program will exit.
If an input filename was given, a temporary file named
.IR input .bch
(if
.I input
is an absolute pathname)
or
.\" =()<.IR @<_PATH_BATCHDIR>@/ input.bch>()=
.IR /var/spool/news/out.going/ input.bch
(if the filename does not begin with a slash) is created.
Once the input is copied,
.I archive
will try to rename this temporary file to be the name of the input file,
and then exit.
