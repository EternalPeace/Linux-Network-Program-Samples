.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I shrinkfile
program shrinks files to a given size, preserving the data at the end of
the file.
Truncation is performed on line boundaries, where a line is a series
of bytes ending with a newline, \en.
There is no line length restriction and files may contain any binary data.
.PP
Temporary files are created in the
.\" =()<.I @<_PATH_TMP>@>()=
.I /tmp
directory.
The ``TMPDIR'' environment variable may be used to specify a
different directory.
.PP
A newline will be added to any non-empty file that does not end with a newline.
The maximum file size will not be exceeded by this addition.
.PP
By default, files are truncated to zero bytes.
The ``\-s'' flag may be used to change the maximum size.
Because the program truncates only on line boundaries, the final size may be
may be smaller then the specified maximum.
The
.I size
parameter may end with a ``k'', ``m'', or ``g'', indicating
kilobyte (1024), megabyte (1048576) or gigabyte (1073741824) lengths.
Uppercase letters are also allowed.
The maximum file size is 2147483647 bytes.
.PP
If the ``\-v'' flag is used, then
.I shrinkfile
will print a status line if a file was shrunk.
