This directory and its subdirectories contains library routines for performing
typical stub functions associated with various Courier programs but widely
exported to other programs.  We need to rethink the naming system here!
Currently implemented:

module	routines			function
auth	MakeSimpleCredsAndVerifier	as the name suggests, given Name
					and password
ch	CH_LookupAddr
	CH_GetFirstCH
	CH_GetOtherCH
	CH_StringToName
	CH_Enumerate
	CH_EnumerateAliases
