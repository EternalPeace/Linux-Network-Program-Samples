This was ported to BSD/386 by Peter Collinson Jan 1992

It is a vanilla 4.14.6 version of Jove, but has my mods for X pointing
added - see xterm-mouse in cmds.doc - this is untested on BSD/386 -
works on my sun. The same code compiles and runs on my Sun - SunOS 4.1.1.

I have also had to make some changes to bring the code into the 1990's:
all calls to select() now use fd_sets for example.

It doesn't compile clean - there are some warnings - life is like that.
