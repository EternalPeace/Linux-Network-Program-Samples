These are the changes done by the `patches' file:

[These patches have been applied, more or less, so I don't supply the
patches file--law]

Compilation of some portions is done conditional on the definition
of the following symbols:

BINARY		Enables the usage of setmode under MSDOS (added binmode command)
BUGGY_MSC	Adds #pragma_function(memset) to avoid internal compiler error
CHOWN		Enables chown
CHROOT		Enables chroot
FORK		Enables fork and changes the compilation of system
GETLOGIN	Enables getlogin
GETPPID		Enables getppid
GROUP		Enables all the group access functions
KILL		Enables kill
LINK		Enables link
PASSWD		Enables all the password access functions
PIPE		Enables the pipe function
WAIT		Enables the wait function
UMASK		Enables the umask function

S_IFBLK *	Enables the block special device check
S_ISGID *	Enables the setgid check
S_ISUID *	Enables the setuid check
S_ISVTX *	Enables the vtx check
unix *		Compiles globbing for Unix
MSDOS *		Compiles globbing for MS-DOS
		Closes stdaux and stdprn on startup
		Adds a copyright message for -v
		Disables the compilation of my_popen, my_pclose as the
		are in a separate file.

Symbols marked with * are defined in the compilation environment.  The
rest should be added to config.h (config.h.SH).  All functions when not
supported give a fatal error.

Added documentation for the binmode function in the manual.

Fixed the following bugs:

In eval.c function eval if ioctl or fcntl returned something
other than 0 or -1 the result was a random number as the
double `value' variable wasn't set to `anum'.

In doio.c function do_exec there were two errors associated with
firing up the shell when the execv fails.  First argv was not freed,
secondly an attempt was made to start up the shell with the cmd
string that was now cut to pieces for the execv.  Also the maxible
possible length of argv was calculated by (s - cmd).  Problem was
that s was not pointing to the end of the string, but to the first
non alpha.

[These are incorporated in patches 15 and 16--law]
