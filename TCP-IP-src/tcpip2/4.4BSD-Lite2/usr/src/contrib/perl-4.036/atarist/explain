Here is a brief explaination of the diffs in perl.diffs. If anything
is unclear please just ask:

General:
  Many of the  #ifdef MSDOS where required for the atari too. In order
to avoid cluttering up the source, upfront in perl.h we #define
MSDOS_OR_ATARI if either defined(MSDOS) or defined(atarist).

 Some of the diffs that i felt were universally applicable are not protected
with #ifdef's. In the explainations below i has indicated all such
changes.

perl.h:
  -- define MSDOS_OR_ATARI if appro.
  -- typedef size_t - assume its there in <stddef.h> if STANDARD_C otherwise
     typedef it to unsigned int (i would have ideally liked unsigned long,
     but we get into trouble with half-assed headers from sun etc)
(this change not protected with a #ifdef since hopefully its universally appli)

  -- make the type of STRLEN size_t for all systems
(this change not protected with a #ifdef since hopefully its universally appli)

  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.

arg.h:
  -- in the atari headers we already have O_PIPE. Change all instances of
     O_PIPE to PERL_O_PIPE. All such changes protected with #ifdef atarist.

handy.h:
  -- make MEM_SIZE size_t like STRLEN.
(this change not protected with a #ifdef since hopefully its universally appli)

doarg.c:
  -- accomodate the large number of args needed for the atari syscall().
  -- do the 9 thru 14 arg versions of syscall for the atarist.

doio.c:
  -- mode[] needed to be  initialized.
(this change not protected with a #ifdef since hopefully its universally appli)

  -- you may find this strange, we do not define STDSTDIO, because even
     though we have the "standard" field in FILE, the semantics are
     different. However, some contexts will work correctly, and there
     you will see #if defined(STDSTDIO) || defined(atarist)

  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.

eval.c:
  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.

malloc.c::
  -- instead of bashfully using ints to hold sizes use MEM_SIZE.
     adjust some casts and printf format specifiers due to this.
     (atarigcc can run in two modes, with 16 or 32 bit ints, so...)
(this change not protected with a #ifdef since hopefully its universally appli)

  -- atarist changes sometimes ||'ed with I286 as appro.

perl.c:
  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.

regcomp.c:
  -- like O_PIPE the atarist headers already has META defined. Change all
     instances of META to PERL_META. All such changes protected with
     #ifdef atarist.

str.c:
  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.

token.c::
  -- META -> PERL_META renaming for atari

util.c::
  -- more adjustments for memory sizes being MEM_SIZE instead of int.
  -- more #ifdef MSDOS -> #ifdef MSDOS_OR_ATARI changes.
