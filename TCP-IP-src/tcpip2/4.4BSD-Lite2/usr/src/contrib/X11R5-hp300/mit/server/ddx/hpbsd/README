This is a native mode X11 R5 server for bsd on hp300's.  This server is
based on the HP R3 server but significantly tidied up and brought up to R5.
This server is significantly faster, and less buggy than the R3 server that
mt Xinu are currently shipping and supports the R4 and R5 extensions (SHAPE,
xdmcp, MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authentication).

This version has the input subsystem reworked and support for the X
input extension added thanks to HP releasing R5 sample code.

Things still to do:
  - fix the monochrome displays so they don't report to be "depth 8".
  - support ngle family of displays and 700 series.


Please report any bugs, problems or ideas for enhancements to me
