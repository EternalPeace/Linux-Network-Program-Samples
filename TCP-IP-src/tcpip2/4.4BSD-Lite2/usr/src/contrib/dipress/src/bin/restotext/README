Module: restotext
Owner: knox
stdout: text description
args:
  name         (name of the input res file)

Description:
   This program reads an RES file and writes out a line-by-line
   text description of the file.  The name of the RES file is the
   the first argument of the command line.  A text description
   of the image is written to the standard output.  The commands
   in the RES file are translated, but the RES file is not executed.

   The image raster will be read from the file "name.res",
   where name is read from the command line.  The ".res"
   extension will not be added if it is already present in the
   name.
