IPMETRICS

Ipmetrics converts Interpress metric masters to the form need by
specific composition systems.

HOW TO ADD A NEW COMPOSITION SYSTEM

To make it easier to add new output capability to ipmetrics, the
interface from the executor has been simplified.  Each composition
system that is supported by ipmetrics is listed in the file
"conf.c".  Basically, for eack system three procedures are provided:
	one that is called for initialization
	one that is called for each property vector
	one that is called to clean-up
In addition, a boolean flag is given to determine whether a configuration
file should be read from the standard input or not.  If the configuration
file is read, then it is placed in a linked list of structures.  The
structures are defined in "config.h".

The initialization  and clean-up procedures are called with a pointer
to the chain of font descriptors.  The procedure to handle each
vector is called with the configuration chain and the vector.
