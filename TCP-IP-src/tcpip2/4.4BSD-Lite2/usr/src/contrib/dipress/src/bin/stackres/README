Description:
   This program reads an RES file, executes it and produces a
   text description file.  The name of the RES file is the
   the first argument of the command line.  The text description
   written to the standard output describes the results left
   on the stack after the image has been executed.

   The image raster will be read from the file "name.res",
   where name is read from the command line.  The ".res"
   extension will not be added if it is already present in the
   name.
