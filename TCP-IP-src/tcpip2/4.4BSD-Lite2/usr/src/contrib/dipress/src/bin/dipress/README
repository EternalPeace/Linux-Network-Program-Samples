This directory contains the source files and the executable file for dipress 
which converts ditroff output to interpress.  It also contains a few other 
things necessary for the correct compilation and operation of dipress.

Source files:

	defs.h		constant and macro definitions for these source files
	deviceinfo.h	file describing device/font dependent data found in
			DESC.OUT file
	types.h		structure declarations used by these source files
	externs.h	external declarations of global variables

	bitdraw.c	incremental bitmap drawing routines for arcs, circles,
			ellipses and wiggly lines
	bitmap.c	interface for building bitmap images,
			used to build pictures for circles, ellipses,
			arcs, and splines.
	font.c		functions used to manipulate font tables
	globals.c	global variables
	ipress.c	contains most of the interpress dependent code for
			dipress 
	main.c		dipress main routine and command line scanning routines
	parser.c	device independent troff command parser
	signals.c	signal handler to insure clean exits


Directions for Installation:

You may also want to change the constant MAX_NUM_FONTS which is currently set
to 60.  (the same way troff in System V, Rel. 2 is distributed)  This number
should match NFONT in your troff sources.  If it doesn't match, bizzare
things will happen... core dumps, random warnings and the like.

Then, a simple "make" should produce a working dipress.
