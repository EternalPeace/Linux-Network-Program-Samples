Include here are some very simple shell scripts that allow
you to tie in the xerox utilities with the ucb lpr system.
This is what we are currently using at Berkeley.  Due to
overworked staff, this is something that hangs together just barely,
and someday we will do better.

If you set this up, you can use ditroff -t | lpr -n,
or maha -t | lpr -t, accross several networked machines. 

The files included here are:

ditroff		--  Shell script for running and spooling "Titroff"
		    (The same script works on all machines at berkeley).
printcap	-- /etc/printcap on the machine that spools to the 8044
remotecap	-- /etc/printcap from a machine that redirects to the first.
xcat		-- a printcap style ditroff converting shell script
xcat2		-- a printcap style ditroff converting shell script
		   designating a second 8044 printer here.
xtcat		-- a printcap style shell script filter for directly spooling
		   interpress files.
ascf.dp		-- a printcap style ascii converting shell script
		   We would like to acknowledge the contribution of the `if'
		   filter to an individual at cornell university, who asked
		   to remain anonymous.
