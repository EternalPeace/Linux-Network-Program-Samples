RELEASE 2.1

[conf/troff]
changed around the configuration files so that all the characters of
TroffClassic can be accessed.  A bug crept in between 1.3 and 2.0 that
suddenly made many special characters unavailable.

[conf/generic]
created.

[dipress]
Added a new feature where the model of Interpress printer can be named on
the call line.  This will cause the Interpress that is generated to be
more suitable for that device than would otherwise be generated.  Added
support for SequenceInsertFile of Interpress and RES files.  Large bitmaps
are now striped for devices like the 8044.

[include/ipnames.h]
Upgraded to Interpress 3.0

[include/iptokens.h]
Upgraded to Interpress 3.0

[include/literal.h]
Put in warning about the dangers of using the Op() macro.  Tried
remove it from existing code.  (suggested by: jqj@cornell)

[ipfe]
new: Interpress file editor - munges pages in a Interpress file.

[ipmetrics]
Straightened out a bug which meant that multiple metrics masters would
not get executed.  Re-organized so that it is easier to add new composition
systems.  Added a "generic" composition system  as a catch-all.

[iptotext]
Changed the output for sequencePackedPixels to print the header info.

[makefile-s]
Cleaned up some of the makefiles.  Primative rdist facility for binaries
added.

[maha]
Reset line to left margin when encountering a carriage return in file.
Added a bunch of suggestions from Larry Parmalee at Cornell Univ.

[makextdev]
Removed debugging messages.

[mp2res]
new: MacPaint to RES converter.

[plot2ip]
new: unix "plot" format files to Interpress.

[texttoip]
fixed a bug where this routine didn't handle strings with escaped
digits to represent non-printing characters.


RELEASE 2.0  -- this release was submitted for 4.3 BSD

[-everything-]
linted for non-portable constructs.  This has caused many of the library
functions to take longs as arguments rather than int's as in the old days.
This package has been tested on a Sun.  That should shake out most of the
byte swap problems.  The only things that still bomb on lint are: stackres,
restotext and ipmetrics.  Ipmetrics does seem to work on a Sun and Vax though.

[include]
iptokens.h incorrectly called maskunderline makeunderline

[ipf]
New: counts pages in a way that should be compatible with the Berkeley spooler.

[ipmetrics]
New conf.troff and conf.tex directories
have been added for creating metrics files for each of these composition
systems.  Since Berkeley hasn't finished the TeX to Interpress converter
yet, we haven't been able to test the output on that system.  In particular,
how on specifies characters not in character set zero remains a mystery.
A man page was also written for this utility.

[libip]
As mentioned above, these routines are now linted.  There is a lint
library ./lib/llib-lip.ln that gives programmers the ability to lint
code that uses the library.  Many routines take long's as arguments
instead of int's.

[qip]
We use a program called "qip" that hooks into BRL's MDQS system.  Since
most places don't have this system, we provide a shell script that
can be modified for local conditions.  Look at the script to see
how to use it.

[restotext]
Contributed by Keith Knox.  Converts and RES file to text form.

[stackres]
Contributed by Keith Knox.  Executes and RES file and prints out what's
on the stack.

[texttoip]
Bug fix: truncate output file on open.  Made it use the same include
files as everybody else.

RELEASE 1.3  -- this release was submitted for 4.3 beta BSD

[dipress]
Modify bitmap.c to output scan lines in multiple of 32 bits for compatibility
with new Xerox print services.  Bell code removed!!!

[doc]
Typo on page 17 in char-chart.me ( \(-| right perpindicular).  Added diff
for eqn/sqrt.c to get better looking square roots.

[iptroff]
Added the -q (quiet) option to not print information on the passes out.
This is handy when running programs in the background.  It is assumed
with the -t option.

[makefiles]
Changed all the makefiles to pass around destinations for the install commmand.
Also changed the destination directories to match 4.3 contributed software
conventions.

RELEASE 1.2

[charset]
Add conditional compilation code for VMS VAX-11 C
Add -o option for output file, modify so -s is point size.

[dipress]
Extended available fonts to include many new characters.
See .../doc/char-chart.me for available character mappings

[doc]
Created documentation for interpress subroutine library

[include]
Added to operator.h to include macros for a more complete operator interface.
Add conditional compilation for VMS VAX-11 C

[iptotext]
Add -d option to force dump of pixel arrays (default now is to not dump them)
Add conditional compilation for VMS VAX-11 C
Fix bug that caused non-printable characters to print as ascii (stripped high
order bit during isprint check)

[libip]
Add conditional compilation for VMS VAX-11 C

[maha]
Add conditional compilation for VMS VAX-11 C

[texttoip]
Add conditional compilation for VMS VAX-11 C

RELEASE 1.1

[charset]
Character sets numbers are now interpreted as being in base eight (8).
Formerly, they were in base ten (10).  This (non-upwardly compatible) change
was made because character-sets are almost always refered to in base 8
by the XNS Architecture documentation.

[iptroff]
The name itroff has been changed to iptroff since itroff is used
at many places to be Imagen Troff.

[misc]
Update to README file on how to customize the troff preprocessors.

RELEASE 1.0

base release.
