.SH NAME
texttoip \- convert an intertext file into Interpress
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texttoip
[
.B \-o
.I outputfile
] [ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Texttoip
will convert a textual representation of an Interpress file (called an
.I intertext
file) into an actual Interpress file.  The utility
.IR iptotext (1)
generates output that is suitable to be used as input to this program.
If
.B \-o
is specified, the Interpress codes are written to the file
.IR outputfile .
If no output file name is given, the output is written to the file
\*(lqintertext.ip\*(rq unless output has been redirected away from
the terminal.  Sending Interpress codes directly to a terminal is not
considered to be a worthwhile operation.
If more than one file is specified as input, the Interpress
header is taken from the first input file and any header specifications in
subsequent files are ignored.
