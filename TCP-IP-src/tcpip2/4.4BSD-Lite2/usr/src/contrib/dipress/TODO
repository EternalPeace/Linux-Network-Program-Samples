Move toward using the Berkeley spooler.

Fix the integer sizing routine so that it doesn't look on -1.

Make append_byte a macro.

ipmetrics: make it count the number of characters per font.

Make ipmetrics produce a little troff file showing all the characters
it has.  Also the font -> troff name mapping and the point sizes available.

Make it possible to add to ipmetrics idea of the point sizes.

For the document:
	Add stuff on how to fix the > 16 font problem in ti-troff.
 
	Add stuff about how to run the toolkit on an IBM-PC.
