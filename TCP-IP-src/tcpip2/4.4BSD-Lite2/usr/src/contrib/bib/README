Description:

Bib is a program for collecting and formatting reference lists in
documents.  It is a preprocessor to the nroff/troff typesetting
systems, much like the tbl [.tbl.] and eqn [.eqn.] systems.  Bib takes
two inputs: a document to be formatted and a library of references.
Imprecise citations in the source document are replaced by more
conventional citation strings, the appropriate references are selected
from the reference file, and commands are generated to format both
citation and the referenced item in the bibliography.
