Greetings

Configuration:
DNS server is Sparc 2 running SunOS 4.1.3, BIND 4.9
ypserver is IBM RS/6000-550 running AIX 3.2.3

Description of problem:
BIND 4.9 documentation recommends removal of "domain" directive in
/etc/named.boot, and disables support for this by default. However,
"ypserv" under AIX does not appear to automatically append the domain
name specified in /etc/resolv.conf to unqualified (i.e. local)
hostnames.

So, the following does work:
	mozart# ypmatch schubert.crs4.it hosts
	156.148.3.24    schubert.crs4.it
while the following does not:
	mozart# ypmatch schubert hosts
	ypmatch: 1831-150 Cannot match key schubert in map hosts.byname.
        Reason: no such key in map.

Possible fixes:
1) Do not use AIX 3.2.x's ypserv. (This works correctly if a Sun is
the ypserver.)
	or
2) Enable LOCALDOM in options.h, and add a domain directive to
named.boot.

Of course, if you have your local hosts in the NIS hosts map, you should
not have a problem. For ease of administration, we only use DNS and
"/usr/etc/yp/makedbm -b".
