Options available in this version of BIND are controlled by conf/options.h,
rather than by $(DEFS) in the Makefile.  The options are:

DEBUG (origin: U C Berkeley)
	enables the -d command line option, and allows SIGUSR1 to increment
and SIGUSR2 to decrement the internal variable "debug", which in turn controls
hundreds of fprintf()'s out to /usr/tmp/named.run.
	you probably want this.  it makes the binary bigger but not slower (or
at least not much slower), but SIGUSR[12] are the only way you'll track down
misconfigured name servers that hose you down with billions of bogus requests.

ALLOW_T_UNSPEC (origin: MIT Project Athena)
	enables the "unspec" RR type for ancient athena software that does not
know about TXT RR's.
	you probably do not care about this.

ALLOW_UPDATES (origin: Mike Schwartz, University of Washington)
	enables "dynamic updates", described in "doc/DynamicUpdate".  this lets
you update named's in-memory database on the fly if you have the right client.
there is absolutely no security around this; if you enable it, anyone who can
reach your server can update your database.
	you probably do not want to enable this.

INVQ (origin: U C Berkeley, with #ifdef's by Paul Vixie)
	enables "inverse queries", which in all of the internet only one client
ever uses: ancient nslookup.  if you build named with INVQ defined as "1",
you get the time-honored behaviour of supporting this whole class of
queries for no real purpose other than to waste a few hundred kilobytes of
your memory and about 3% of named's total CPU time.  if you build with
INVQ set to "0", old nslookups will not be able to reach your server in their
startup phase, and you will have to use the "server" command after it fails
over to some other server.
	you probably want this.

DSTORAGE (origin: U C Berkeley, with #ifdef's by Paul Vixie)
	enables a malloc-debugger that checks for overruns on both ends of
each allocated block of memory.  used when debugging since C has no bounds
or type checking.
	you probably do not want this.

DMALLOC (origin: Paul Vixie of Digital)
	enables a malloc-debugger that traces all allocated blocks of memory
such that SIGIOT's output (see STATS, above) includes a list of all malloc's
in the program, how many times each has been called, how many blocks of memory
allocated by that malloc are not yet free, and how many bytes they use up.
under each one will be a list of each free/realloc that has deallocated a block
of that malloc's memory, and how many times it has done so.
	this is extremely helpful for finding memory leaks.  as such, you
probably do not want this unless you are debugging named.

CRED (origin: Paul Vixie of Digital)
	enables a system of "credibility checking" on all data in the memory-
resident database.  every RR that comes in will be tagged with a credibility
index with zone files being highest, followed by authoritative answers, then
non-authoritative answers, then finally by additional data.  when any RR is
being added to a node ("name") in the database, all RR's of that type with a
lower credibility index will be flushed.  this tends to do away with additional
data, which is one of the greatest sources of database pollution in the DNS.
data that comes in with lower credibility than what we already have is ignored.
	with CRED enabled, additional data is deprecated such that every
time an additional-data RR is used, its Time To Live (TTL) is multiplied by
0.95, effectively lowering it by 5% of its current value.  this causes
additional data to be timed out rather quickly, and as soon as it times
out, a sysquery() will be sent to some authoritative server, which in turn
results in a real live answer which tends to lock out future additional
data on that <name,type> tuple.
	due to source dependencies, CRED also controls a bug fix that keeps
all sysquery() responses from being entered into the "root cache".  you can
see the effect of this by dumping your database to disk with SIGINT and
looking at the bottom of the file.  try it with and without CRED, letting a
few million queries through first.  without CRED, you'll see a bunch of
non-root junk in the section of the dump that is reserved for the "hints".
	you probably want this.

XFRNETS (origin: Paul Vixie of Digital)
	enables the "xfrnets" command in named.boot.  this has the same
syntax as "forwarders" and "sortlist" -- that is, a list of dotted quads.
each one is a network (16.0.0.0 and 130.180.0.0 are examples) or a host.
if you put any xfrnets commands into your named.boot, then zone transfers
will only be honored if they come from inside one of the specified
networks.  this is very useful if you want to keep people outside from
being able to trivially map your entire network, but it doesn't stop them
from iterating so it's more annoying than secure.
	this feature was once called "tcplist" out of ignorance on my part,
but with advice from phil almquist i decided to rename it "xfrnets" and make
it only control zone transfers -- previously it controlled all TCP connections
which made certain TCP-only resolvers unable to use our servers.  the "tcplist"
syntax still works; it is a synonym for "xfrnets".
	you probably do not care about this.

PID_FIX (origin: Don Lewis of Harris)
	tells named that if it starts up but can't keep going because another
nameserver is already running (and sitting on the server port), it should
put the /etc/named.pid (/var/run/named.pid) file back the way it found it.
	you probably want this.

FWD_LOOP (origin: Don Lewis of Harris)
	tells named that if you list any of your own IP addresses in a
"forwarders" command in your named.boot file, you should be scolded.
	you probably want this.

NO_GLUE (origin: Don Lewis of Harris, and Andrew Partan of UUNET)
	tells named-xfer that incoming zone transfers should be checked
for "glue" that comes from a zone outside the zone being transferred, and
comment this garbage out in the zone file so that when named reads in the
zone file after named-xfer exits, the garbage will not be entered into the
memory-resident database.
	also tells named that when it is performing an outgoing zone
transfer, it should not send any of these "glue" records.
	you definitely want this.

BOGUSNS (origin: Piet Beertema of EUNet)
	enables the "bogusns" command in named.boot.  this has the same
syntax as forwarders and sortlist.  any NS RR's that come in whose addresses
are on the list of "bogusns" addresses will be ignored.  this is the last
resort when someone is bogusly advertising themselves as a root server.
	you probably want this, just in case, though you won't use it often.

QRYLOG (origin: Bryan Beecher of UMich)
	enables "query logging", such that SIGWINCH toggles tracing of all
incoming queries.  the trace is sent to syslog, and is huge, but when you
need this you will need it bad and it does not slow named down or make it
larger.
	If you define QRYLOG you may also start up named in query logging
mode by using the -q flag.  If you do so you will probably want to analyze
the logs produced, the dnsstats and lamers scrips (in the contrib/umich
directory) will do it for you.
	you probably want this.

LOGFAC (origin: various people)
	If you start up named with the -q flag you will be logging
large amounts of data, and probably will not want them logged to the
default logging facility, which is LOG_DAEMON.  You will want to
redefine LOGFAC, presumably to LOC_LOCALn (0 <= n <= 7).  Remember to
modify /etc/syslog.conf appropriately.
	This only works on a system with a modern syslogd.

YPKLUDGE (origin: Piet Beertema of EUNet)
	certain versions of NIS/YP are capable of using the DNS for names
that cannot be found in the YP servers.  of these, certain versions can't
tell the difference between a dotted quad and a domain name, and they send
queries to the DNS for dotted quads as if they were domain names.  if your
named does not do anything special with these queries, they will end up
getting forwarded to other servers, effectively hosing all of you down with
endless useless network traffic.  YPKLUDGE enables some checking in named
that lets it catch these bogus queries and send back immediate errors.
	If you run "ypserv -i" you definitely want this, as a malconfigured
NIS server can cause DNS "flood" queries otherwise. Trust me.

TRACEROOT (origin: pma@cnd.hp.com and Bryan Beecher of UMich)
	enables some checking in named for bogus root nameservers.  This
code has been in use at U-M for years, so it is pretty well tested, plus we
have never been burned by the "bogus root NS scares" that have plagued the
DNS off and on.
	this is a feature that people will very much want to use.

LOCALDOM (origin: Berkeley)
	if set, the "domain" directive is recognized in the named.boot file.
this causes us to retry queries with the specified domain appended to the
name if the first lookup fails.  this is a very bad idea since a given name
server will often be used by clients in more than one domain -- a name server
should _not_ make any presumptions as to the "home domain" of a requestor.
	you almost certainly do not want this.

SLAVE_FORWARD (origin: pma@sdd.hp.com)
	if set, "slave" servers behave in an arguably more-correct way.  this
is an experimental addition to BIND 4.9 that causes slaves to time out queries
in 60/N seconds where N is the number of forwarders defined.  previously a
query would time out almost immediately, which caused a lot of unneccessary
network traffic.
	you probably want this, and you will get it by default in 4.9.1.

FORCED_RELOAD (origin: pma@sdd.hp.com)
	if set, then when a HUP signal is received, all secondary zones are
scheduled for serial-number comparison with the primaries.  this has the effect
that if you HUP your server, it will refresh any zones which have changed,
even if those zones refresh times have not been reached.
	you probably want this, and you will get it by default in 4.9.1.

WANT_PIDFILE (origin: berkeley, parameterized by arc@sgi)
	if set, a file called named.pid will be created in /etc or /var/run
when the name server has started.  this file can be used to send signals to
BIND, as in "kill -HUP `cat /etc/named.pid`".
	you probably want this, unless you are on an SGI (where killall(1M)
makes the pid file unnecessary)

DOTTED_SERIAL (origin: berkeley; parameterized by vixie)
	if set, allows a somewhat arcane n.m syntax in the serial number
field of an SOA.  this is officially deprecated for 4.9; you should use
straight integer values and find an encoding that does not depend on 
scaled-integer pseudodecimals.  i suggest YYYYMMDDnn where YYYY is the
four-digit year, MM is the two-digit month, DD is the two-digit day-of-month,
and nn is a daily version number in case you change your serial number more
than once in a day.  this encoding will overflow in the year 4294 gregorian.
	you almost certainly do not want this, but if you have old zone files
laying around and you don't want to think your way through converting their
serial numbers, this deprecated behaviour is available.

SENSIBLE_DOTS (origin: kagotani@cs.titech.ac.jp; parameterized by vixie)
	if set, changes the semantics of an "n.m" serial number from
		n*10^(3+int(0.9+log10(m))) + m
to
		n*10000+m
	if you are using DOTTED_SERIAL in spite of its deprecated status,
and you are interested in a more predictable and sensible interpretation of
dotted numbers, then you probably want this.

VALIDATE (origin: USC/ISI)
	enables a validation procedure to provide some security in an
otherwise insecure environment. Any RRs are accepted from a server only if
the server is authoritative over that domain. We consider a server
authoritative (for validation purposes) for even the sub-domains that it has
delegated to others. RRs are validated against the data we have in cache
already. Invalid records are neither cached, nor returned.
	you should try this but be careful with it as it is still experimental.
some users have reported unpredictable results.

NCACHE (origin: USC/ISI)
	enables negative caching. We cache only authoritative NXDOMAIN or
authoritative NOERROR with zero RR count. Non-authoritative NXDOMAIN answers
now contain NS records in the authority section. Non-authoritative NOERROR
responses have no authority or additional records to differentiate them from
referrals. They are cached for NTTL secs (currently 10 minutes) and are timed
out when the ttl expires.
	you should try this but be careful with it as it is still experimental.
some users have reported unpredictable results.

RESOLVSORT (origin: marka@syd.dms.csiro.au)
	enable sorting of addresses returned by gethostbyname. Sorting order
is specified by address/netmask pairs. This enables a host to override the
sortlist specified in the nameserver.

STUBS (origin: marka@syd.dms.csiro.au)
	enable teransfer and loading of NS records only for a zone.

SUNSECURITY (origin: rossc@ucc.su.oz.au)
	enable checking of PTR records in gethostbyaddr() to detect
	spoofing. Always on on suns as rlogin etc. depend on this.

SECURE_ZONES (origin: gshapiro@wpi.edu)
	enables support for secure zones.  This restricts access to
information in the zone according to the information found in the
secure_zone TXT RR found in the zone.  If none is found, the zone is
world readable.  For information on the format of the secure_zone TXT
RR, see the Name Server Operations Guide for BIND.

ROUND_ROBIN (origin: Marshall Rose of TPC.INT)
	if set, causes the databuf list in a namebuf to be rotated by one
slot after each access to it.  this has the effect that if multiple RR's
of a given type are present, they will be given in "round robin" order 
instead of always being given in the same order.
	you probably want this, in preference to SHUFFLE_ADDRS.

ADDAUTH (origin: marka@syd.dms.csiro.au)
	if set, cause NS and glue A records to be returned with authorative
answers.  still experimental; don't use this unless you want to work on it.

RFC1535 (origin: paul@vix.com)
	if set, the resolver's default "search" list will be just the entire
"domain" name rather than the sliding window it had before 4.9.2.  this will
make the default search list shorter, so folks who are saying "domain a.b.c"
and relying on the implicit "search a.b.c a.b c" will miss "a.b" and "c".
	this option is on by default for compatibility with RFC 1535.  you
should NOT turn it off.

GEN_AXFR (origin: mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz, tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU, gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk)
	if set, allows specification of zones in classes other than "IN" in
the named.boot file. Allows an optional "/class" on the "primary" and
"secondary" directives.  Also fixes zone transfers so only data in the class
requested is transfered.

DATUMREFCNT (origin: mark andrews)
	you want this.  it will not be optional in future releases.
