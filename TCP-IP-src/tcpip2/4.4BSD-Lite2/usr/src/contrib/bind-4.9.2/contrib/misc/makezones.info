I have written a Perl script called "makezones" which builds one forwards zone 
file and any number of reverse zone files from a single source file. (For 
example, I build the files for cam.ac.uk, 111.131.in-addr.arpa, and 
213.153.192.in-addr.arpa from a single source.)

The script does extensive checks on the syntax of the input, and it also checks 
for duplicate IP addresses and the use of CNAME domain names on other types of 
record (which is illegal). The serial number on the SOA record is automatically 
updated each time makezones is run; it is expected to be in the very common
<year><mon><day><seq> format, but the year must be four digits - this code is 
built to survive the turn of the century...

The script is extensively commented and has a long description at its start. 
Some of its features are configurable by setting appropriate Perl variables at 
the start. These are all documented. Hacking for other requirements should be 
relatively straightforward.

Makezones is available for ftp from

   ftp.cus.cam.ac.uk:/pub/software/programs/DNS/makezones
   
I'll be happy to receive comments and suggestions and bug reports.
