for the BIND 4.9 "contrib" distribution, i removed the author's copy of
"doc" and replaced it with a context diff from the ISI version.  use the
"patch" utility to build the appropriate "doc" version for use with this
tool.  if you don't know about "patch", keep moving, you're in the wrong
directory.				Paul Vixie, DECWRL, May 1993
