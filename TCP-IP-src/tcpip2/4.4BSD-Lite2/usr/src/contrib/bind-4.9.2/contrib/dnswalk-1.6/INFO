dnswalk is a DNS debugger.  It performs zone transfers of specified domains,
and checks the database in numerous ways for internal consistency, as well
as accuracy.

dnswalk requires perl and dig.  (Tested under perl-4.036, dig 2.0, and the
dig shipped with BIND 4.9.x) If you do not have these tools, get them.
(perl is assumed to be in /usr/local/bin, edit the first line of dnswalk
if it is not)

They can be found by anonymous ftp at:
ftp.uu.net:/networking/ip/dns/dig.2.0.tar.Z
ftp.uu.net:/systems/gnu/perl-*.tar.Z
gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/BSD/bind/4.9/4.9.*.tar.Z

dnswalk works much better if you use the dig that is packaged with the
BIND 4.9.x distribution.  (It is much less buggy than its predecessor)

dnswalk is not the be-all end-all tool for checking the integrity of your
DNS database.  I would suggest it be used after using 'doc', written by
Steve Hotz (hotz@isi.edu) and Paul Mockapetris (pvm@isi.edu).  It can be
found via FTP from: ftp.uu.net:/networking/ip/dns/doc.2.0.tar.Z [and in
the contrib/ subdir of 4.9.x's source kit]

dnswalk is not a replacement for doc.  This was written to check individual
database entries, while 'doc' ensures that the overall database structure
and authority records are consistent.  dnswalk may not even function correctly
if authority records are missing or incorrect.

This program may be freely distributed, as long as this notice and
documentation are distributed with the program.  This program is
released as-is, with no warranty expressed or implied.  Some assembly
required, contents may settle during shipment.  This program can be
found at ftp.pop.psu.edu:/pub/src/dnswalk/dnswalk.1.6.tar.Z,
ftp.univ-lyon1.fr:/pub/mirrors/unix/dnswalk, and probably also in
ftp.uu.net:/networking/ip/dns.
