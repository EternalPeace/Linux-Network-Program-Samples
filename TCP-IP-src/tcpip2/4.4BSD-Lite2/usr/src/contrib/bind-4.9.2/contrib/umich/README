Paul, I have the following for the 'contrib' directory.

	query.c
	query.1

	This is an alternative to 'nslookup' that I wrote a long time ago.
	Unlike a lot of the DNS query programs, it actually uses the resolver
	library.

	lamers.sh
	lamer-message
	LISA-VI-paper.ps

	This is the shell script that scans our log files for lame delegation
	messages and sends mail to the appropriate hostmasters.  There's also
	a paper I gave at the last LISA which describes it.

All of this stuff is on terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu in /dns.  Can you pick
it up, or would you prefer I e-mail it?
