# this file tells mkdb what MX's to use on any host.  the entry marked "*"
# is not a wildcard MX (since these are a bad idea), but rather is added
# to every host's MX.
#
# there are no order-dependencies in this file; the "*" entry can appear
# anywhere.  note that every host will automatically be its own "cost 0"
# MX; anything else from this file will be added on top of that default.
#
# as in named, the "@" name represents the domain's root.
