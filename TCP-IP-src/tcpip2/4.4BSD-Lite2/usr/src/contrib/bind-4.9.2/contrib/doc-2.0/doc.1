.SH NAME
doc \- diagnose unhealthy DNS domains
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B doc
.RI [-p]
.RI [-e][-w][-v][-d]
.I domain_name
.RI [parent_domain_name]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDoc\fP is an automated tool for verifying (to an extent) that a
domain is configured and functioning correctly.  The only required
parameter is the valid domain name of an
existing domain. Example:
.sp 1
		doc isi.edu.
.sp 1
If the parent (delegating) domain can be determined simply
by stripping off the first domain part and subsequent dot from
the specified domain name, then there is no need to include
the parent_domain_name parameter.  Examples:
.sp 1
.nf
	doc isi.edu. edu.			(this is correct)
	doc isi.edu.    			(this works too)
	doc 9.128.in-addr.arpa. arpa.	(this is correct)
	doc 9.128.in-addr.arpa.		(this will NOT work)
.fi
.sp 1
In the last (incorrect) example, because there is no parent
domain specified, \fIdoc\fP fills in the optional parent_domain
parameter, and runs as if you specified:
.sp 1
	doc 9.128.in-addr.arpa. 128.in-addr.arpa.
.sp 1
Since, the delegation information for 9.128.in-addr.arpa. is
not at 128.in-addr.arpa. (rather at arpa.), this run will
abort, and not report as expected.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\-p"
Skip testing the information held at delegating domain's servers.
.sp 1
The default operation of \fIdoc\fP includes testing that all of the
servers for the delegating (parent) domain agree about the
delegation information held for the domain in question.  Since
inconsistencies discovered at this level may or may not indicate
serious problems, one can choose to skip the parent testing.
If so, \fIdoc\fP uses the first non-authoritative list of NS records
from a parent domain server as those to direct further queries.
If all of the parent domain servers are additionally authoritative
for the domain, the answer from the last one queried is used.
This may be a useful timesaver if you are regularly checking up
on a large number of domains.  [See also section FILES USED for
a similar functionality.]


.IP "\-[e][w][v][d]  Specify the level of verbosity to standard output."
.sp 1
The default mode of operation is to only print to standard output
a summary of what is discovered.  In addition, errors made in the
process of testing (i.e. query errors, errors causing \fIdoc\fP to
abort, etc) are noted.
.sp 1
.nf
    -e	Output comments about errors discovered.
    -w	Output comments about warnings issued.
    -v	Verbose output. Include misc. comments and output
		confirming correct behavior.
    -d	Debug output. Checkpoint current (last) nameserver query.
.fi
.sp 1
These output options are cumulative (i.e. -v implies -v -w -e).
.sp 1
\fBNOTE:\fP Parsing is very simple.  All option flags must come
before the domain names.
.SH FILES CREATED
In addition to the standard output, \fIdoc\fP produces a log file
named log.<domain_name>, which it places in the current
directory.  This file includes all "verbose" level comments,
followed by the nameserver responses to the queries (in a
slightly masticated form).
.sp 1
While running, \fIdoc\fP creates several temporary files in the
current directory.  These files have names of the form:
.sp 1
	<domain_name>.* 
.SH FILES USED
\fIDoc\fP expects the auxiliary files: doc1.awk, doc3.awk, and
doc4.awk to reside in the current working directory.
.sp 1
\fIDoc\fP looks for the file DNsrv.<parent_domain_name> in the
working directory.  If it exists, \fIdoc\fP does not make a standard
query to discover the list of nameservers for the parent domain.
Rather it queries the list of servers contained in this file to
obtain delegation information for the domain being tested.  This
may be useful if one regularly tests a series of domains, all
with the same delegating zone, where one of the servers in known
to be foul.  This server would simply be omitted from the the
DNsrv.* file.
.sp 1
awk, sed & dig (version 2.0 or higher) are expected to be found
in your normal path.  If not, you may want to alias to the full
path inside of \fIdoc\fP itself.
.SH DETAILS
See file INFO (included with distribution tar) for details of
procedure.

.SH BUGS
The exit code returned via the shell is only 8 bits.  This could
cause a problem in the value returned by the auxiliary file doc3.awk.
This hasn't been seen yet (a "poison configuration" is not likely to
occur yet), and hopefully will be corrected if/when
\fIdoc\fP is re-implemented (see below).
.sp 1
The current implementation is fairly simple (albeit not pretty),
so it is not expected to abort unexpectedly.  However, this
version (2.0) is an initial attempt at automating this task.
Further development is expected in identifying the appropriate
queries, analysis, and subsequent conclusions that are made.
Hopefully once the design of the test suite has become more stable,
a less "patchwork" production version of \fIdoc\fP will be done.
.sp 1
Comments are very much welcome.
