Archive-Name: dnswalk.1.6.shar

	This release corrects some major bugs if you use the dig supplied
with BIND 4.9, as its output is ever-so-slightly different than the "old"
dig 2.0.  Also other minor corrections.

Below are the changes since 1.5

Version 1.6
removed -c switch, since I thought it would work a long time ago, but
later found out it could never be made to work.  Well, it could, just
not very nicely.  (nor efficiently)

Fixed bug with parsing of dig output.  Newer dig has slightly different
output, causing serial numbers to not be pulled out.

Changed the do-dnswalk script to use exec > logfile instead of
redirecting every invocation to a logfile.  Idea from Dan Ehrlich.

Fixed problem with dnswalk using old list of subdomains in axfr file,
ignoring the new zone transfer if it was needed.

Accounted for annoying behavior of new dig to print duplicate SOA's.

Documented nameserver error reporting.



	For those unfamiliar, dnswalk is a perl script that will find
inconsistencies and general Bad Things in a DNS domain.  It is meant to
pick up where 'doc' left off.  dnswald checks individual resource
record entries, while doc just checks to see if your overall
delegations are consistent.
