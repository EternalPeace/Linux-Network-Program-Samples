.SH DESCRIPTION 
.I host
looks for information about Internet hosts and domain names.
It gets this information from a set of interconnected servers
that are spread across the world. The information is stored
in the form of "resource records" belonging to hierarchically
organized "zones".
.PP
By default, the program simply converts between host names and Internet
addresses. However, with the \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-a\fP and \fB\-v\fP
options, it can be used to find all of the information about
domain names that is maintained by the domain nameserver system.
The information printed consists of various fields of the
associated resource records that were retrieved.
.PP
The arguments can be either host names (domain names) or numeric
Internet addresses.
.PP
A numeric Internet address consists of four decimal numbers
separated by dots, e.g. \fB192.16.199.1\fP, representing the
four bytes of the 32-bit address.
.br
The default action is to look up the associated host name.
.PP
A host name or domain name consists of component names (labels)
separated by dots, e.g. \fBnikhefh.nikhef.nl\fP
.br
The default action is to look up all of its Internet addresses.
.PP
For single names without a trailing dot, the local domain is
automatically tacked on the end.
Thus a user in domain "nikhef.nl" can say "host nikhapo",
and it will actually look up "nikhapo.nikhef.nl".
In all other cases, the name is tried unchanged.
Single names with trailing dot are considered top-level domain
specifications, e.g. "nl."
.PP
Note that the usual lookup convention for any name that does not end
with a trailing dot is to try first with the local domain appended,
and possibly other search domains.
This convention is not used by this program.
.PP
The actual suffix to tack on the end is usually the local domain
as specified in the \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP file, but this can be
overridden.
See below for a description of how to customize the host name lookup.
.SH ARGUMENTS
The first argument is normally the host name (domain name) for which
you want to look up the requested information.
If the first argument is an Internet address, a query is done on the
special "reversed mapping" domain to look up its associated host name.
.PP
If the \fB\-l\fP option is given, the first argument is a domain zone
name for which a complete listing is given. The program enters a
special zone listing mode which has several variants (see below).
.PP
The second argument is optional. It allows you to specify a particular
server to query.  If you don't specify this argument, default servers
are used, as defined by the \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP file.
.SH EXTENDED SYNTAX
If the \fB\-x\fP option is given, it extends the syntax in the sense
that multiple arguments are allowed on the command line. An optional
explicit server must now be specified using the \fB\-X\fP option as it
cannot be given as an ordinary argument any more. The \fB\-X\fP
option implies \fB\-x\fP.
.sp
The extended syntax allows no arguments at all, in which case the
arguments will be read from standard input. This can be a pipe,
redirection from a file, or an interactive terminal. Note that
these arguments are the names to be queried, and not command options.
Everything that appears after a '#' or ';' on an input line will be
skipped. Multiple arguments per line are allowed.
.SH OPTIONS
There are a number of options that can be used before the specified
arguments.  Some of these options are meaningful only to the people
who maintain the domain database zones.
The first options are the regularly used ones.
.TP 4
.B \-v
causes printout to be in a "verbose" format.
All resource record fields are printed.
Without this option, the TTL and class fields are not shown.
Also the contents of the "additional information" and "authoritative
nameservers" sections in the answer from the nameserver are printed,
if present.  Normally these sections are not shown.
In addition, the verbose option prints extra information about the
various actions that are taken by the program.
Note that \fB\-vv\fP is "very verbose". This generates a lot of output.
.TP
.BI \-t " querytype"
allows you to specify a particular type of resource record information
to be looked up.  Supported types are listed below.
The wildcard may be written as either \fBANY\fP or \fB*\fP.
Types may be given in upper or lower case.
The default is type \fBA\fP for regular lookups,
and \fBA\fP, \fBNS\fP, and \fBPTR\fP for zone listings.
.TP
.B \-a
is equivalent to \fB\-t ANY\fP.
Note that this gives you "anything available" (currently cached) and
not "all defined data" if a non-authoritative server is queried.
.SH SPECIAL MODES
The following options put the program in a special mode.
.TP 4
.BI \-l " zone"
generates the listing of an entire zone.
.sp
E.g. the command
.br
	\fBhost \-l nikhef.nl\fP
.br
will give a listing of all hosts in the "nikhef.nl" zone.
The \fB\-t\fP option is used to filter what information is
extracted, as you would expect. The default is address
information from A records, supplemented with data from PTR
and NS records.
.sp
The command
.br
	\fBhost \-v \-a \-l nikhef.nl\fP
.br
will give a complete download of the zone data for "nikhef.nl",
in the official master file format.
.TP 4
.B \-H
can be specified instead of the \fB\-l\fP option. It will print
the count of the unique hostnames (names with an A record)
encountered within the zone.
It will not count pseudo names like "localhost", nor addresses
associated with zone name itself. Neither are counted the
"glue records" that are necessary to define nameservers for
the zone and its delegated zones.
.sp
By default, this option will not print any resource records.
.sp
Combined with the \fB\-S\fP option, it will give a complete
statistics survey of the zone.
.sp
The host count may be affected by duplicate hosts (see below).
To compute the most realistic value, subtract the duplicate
host count from the total host count.
.TP
.B \-G
implies \fB\-H\fP, but lists the names of gateway hosts.
These are the hosts that have more than one address.
Gateway hosts are not checked for duplicate addresses.
.TP
.B \-E
implies \fB\-H\fP, but lists the names of extrazone hosts.
An extrazone host in zone "foo.bar" is of the form
"host.xxx.foo.bar" where "xxx.foo.bar" is not defined as
a delegated zone with an NS record.
This may be intentional, but also may be an error.
.TP
.B \-D
implies \fB\-H\fP, but lists the names of duplicate hosts.
These are hosts with only one address, which is known to
have been defined also for another host with a different name,
possibly even in a different zone.
This may be intentional, but also may be an error.
.TP
.B \-C
can be specified instead of the \fB\-l\fP option. It causes the SOA
records for the specified zone to be compared as found at each of
the authoritative nameservers for the zone (as listed in the NS records).
Nameserver recursion is turned off, and it will be checked whether
the answers are really authoritative. If a server cannot provide an
authoritative SOA record, a lame delegation of the zone to that server
is reported.
Discrepancies between the records are reported. Various sanity checks
are performed.
.TP
.B \-A
enters a special address check mode.
.sp
If the first argument is a host name, its addresses will be retrieved,
and for each of the addresses it will be checked whether they map back
to the given host.
.sp
If the first argument is a dotted quad Internet address, its name will
be retrieved, and it will be checked whether the given address is listed
among the known addresses belonging to that host.
.SH SPECIAL OPTIONS
The following options apply only to the special zone listing modes.
.TP 4
.BI \-L " level"
Recursively generate zone listings up to this level deep.
Level 1 traverses the parent zone and all of its delegated zones.
Each additional level descends into another layer of delegated zones.
.TP
.B \-S
prints statistics about the various types of resource records found
during zone listings, the number of various host classifications,
the number of delegated zones, and some total statistics after
recursive listings.
.TP
.B \-p
causes only the primary nameserver of a zone to be contacted for zone
transfers during zone listings. Normally, zone transfers are obtained
from any one of the authoritative servers that responds.  Note that
a specific server given on the command line overrules this option.
The primary nameserver is obtained from the SOA record of the zone.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
The following options can be used in both normal mode and domain
listing mode.
.TP 4
.B \-T
prints the time-to-live values during non-verbose output.
By default the TTL is shown only in verbose mode.
It also prints the preference value for MX records.
.TP
.B \-d
turns on debugging.  Nameserver transactions are shown in detail.
Note that \fB\-dd\fP prints even more debugging output.
.TP
.B \-e
excludes information about names that are not residing within
the given zone during zone listings, such as some glue records.
For regular queries, it suppresses the printing of the "additional
information" and "authoritative nameserver" sections in the answer
from the nameserver.
.TP
.BI \-f " filename"
writes the resource record output to the given logfile as well as
to standard output.
.TP
.BI \-F " filename"
same as \fB\-f\fP, but exchange the role of stdout and logfile.
All stdout output goes to the logfile, and stdout gets only the
extra resource record output (so that it can be used in pipes).
This option is supported on a few platforms only.
.TP
.B \-i
constructs a query for the "reversed mapping" \fBin-addr.arpa\fP
domain in case a numeric (dotted quad) address was specified.
Useful primarily for zone listing mode, since for numeric regular
lookups such query is done anyway (but with \-i you see the actual
PTR resource record outcome).
.TP
.B \-q
be quiet and suppress various warning messages (the ones preceded
by " !!! ").
Serious error messages (preceded by " *** ") are never suppressed.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
The following options are used only in special circumstances.
.TP 4
.BI \-c " class"
allows you to specify a particular resource record class.
Supported are
\fBIN\fP, \fBINTERNET\fP, \fBCS\fP, \fBCSNET\fP, \fBCH\fP, \fBCHAOS\fP,
\fBHS\fP, \fBHESIOD\fP, and the wildcard \fBANY\fP or \fB*\fP.
The default class is \fBIN\fP.
.TP
.B \-m
is equivalent to \fB\-t MAILB\fP, which filters
any of types \fBMB\fP, \fBMR\fP, \fBMG\fP, or \fBMINFO\fP.
In addition, \fBMR\fP and \fBMG\fP records will be recursively
expanded into \fBMB\fP records.
.TP
.B \-r
causes nameserver recursion to be turned off in the request.
This means that the contacted nameserver will return only data
it has currently cached in its own database.
It will not ask other servers to retrieve the information.
Note that nameserver recursion is always turned off when checking
SOA records using the \fB\-C\fP option. Authoritative servers
should have all relevant information available.
.TP
.B \-R
Normally querynames are assumed to be fully qualified and are
tried as such, unless it is a single name, which is always tried
(and only once) in the default domain.
This option simulates the default BIND behaviour by qualifying
any specified name by repeatedly adding search domains, with
the exception that the search terminates immediately if the name
exists but does not have the desired querytype.
The default search domains are constructed from the default domain
by repeatedly peeling off the first component, until a final domain
with only one dot remains.
.TP
.B \-u
forces the use of virtual circuits instead of datagrams when issuing
nameserver queries. This is slower, but potentially more reliable.
Note that a virtual circuit is automatically chosen in case a query
exceeds the maximum datagram packet size. Also if a datagram answer
turns out to be truncated, the query is retried using virtual circuit.
A zone transfer is always done via a virtual circuit.
.TP
.B \-w
causes the program to retry forever if the response to a regular query
times out. Normally it will time out after some 10 seconds per
nameserver address tried.
.TP
.BI \-s " seconds"
specifies a new nameserver timeout value. The program will wait
for a nameserver reply in two attempts of this number of seconds.
Normally it does 2 attempts of 5 seconds per nameserver address tried.
The actual timeout algorithm is slightly more complicated, extending
the timeout value dynamically depending on the number of tries and
the number of nameserver addresses.
.TP
.B \-V
prints just the version number of the \fBhost\fP program, and exits.
.SH DEFAULT OPTIONS
Default options and parameters can be preset in an environment
variable \fBHOST_DEFAULTS\fP using the same syntax as on the command
line. They will be evaluated before the command line arguments.
.SH QUERYTYPES
The following querytypes (resource record types) are supported.

.SH STATUS MESSAGES
The following are status messages that are printed to show
the result of a particular query. The name of an explicit
server, if specified, may be included. If a special class
is specified, it is also shown.
.TP 4
Nameserver not running
The contacted server host does not have a nameserver running.
.TP
Nameserver not responding
The nameserver at the contacted server host did not give a reply
within the specified time frame.
.TP
Nameserver not reachable
The network route to the intended server host is blocked.
.TP
\fIname\fP does not exist (Authoritative answer)
The queryname does definitely not exist at all.
.TP
\fIname\fP does not exist, try again
The queryname does not exist, but the answer was not authoritative,
so it is still undecided.
.TP
\fIname\fP \fItype\fP record not found, try again
Some intermediate nameserver failure, e.g. timeout.
.TP
\fIname\fP \fItype\fP record not found, no recovery
Some irrecoverable format error, or server refusal.
.TP
\fIname\fP has no \fItype\fP record (Authoritative answer)
The queryname is valid, but the specified type does not exist.
This status is here returned only in case authoritative.
.TP
\fIname\fP \fItype\fP record currently not present
The specified type does not exist, but we don't know whether
the queryname is valid or not. The answer was not authoritative.
Perhaps recursion was off, and no data was cached locally.
.TP
\fIzone\fP has lame delegation to \fIserver\fP
If we query a supposedly authoritative nameserver for the SOA record
of a zone, the information should be available and the answer should
be authoritative. If not, a lame delegation is flagged. This is also
done if the server turns out not to exist at all. Ditto if we ask for
a zone transfer and the server cannot provide it.
.SH WARNING AND ERROR MESSAGES
Miscellaneous warning messages may be generated.
They are preceded by " !!! " and indicate some non-fatal condition.
These messages can be suppressed with the \-q command line option.
Error messages are preceded by " *** " and indicate a serious problem.
Those messages cannot be suppressed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The program returns a zero exit status if the requested information
could be retrieved successfully, or in case zone listings or SOA
checks were performed without any serious error.
Otherwise it returns a non-zero exit status.
.SH CUSTOMIZING HOST NAME LOOKUP
In general, if the name supplied by the user does not have any dots
in it, a default domain is appended to the end. This domain is usually
defined in the \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP file. If not, it is derived by
taking the local hostname and taking everything after its first dot.
.PP
The user can override this, and specify a different default domain,
by defining it in the environment variable \fILOCALDOMAIN\fP.
.PP
In addition, the user can supply his own single-word abbreviations
for host names. They should be in a file consisting of one line per
abbreviation. Each line contains an abbreviation, white space, and
then the fully qualified host name. The name of this file must be
specified in the environment variable \fIHOSTALIASES\fP.
.SH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The complete set of resource record information for a domain name
is available from an authoritative nameserver only. Therefore,
if you query another server with the "-a" option, only a subset
of the data may be presented, since this option asks for any data
that the latter server currently knows about, not all data that
may possibly exist.  Note that the "-v" option shows whether an
answer is authoritative or not.
.PP
When listing a zone with the "-l" option, information will be fetched
from authoritative nameservers for that zone. This is implemented by
doing a complete zone transfer and then filtering out the information
theat you have asked for.
Note that direct contact with such nameservers must be possible for
this option to work.
This option should be used with caution. Servers may be configured
to refuse zone transfers if they are flooded with requests.
