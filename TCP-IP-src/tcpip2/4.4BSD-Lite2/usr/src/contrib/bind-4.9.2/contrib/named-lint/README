This is "still" fairly ugly code, but it works enough right now.  I'm
(in the backround) working on a better version, but figured I'd send
this in, just in case you want it.  There is no seperate
documentation, just "usage" and the code.

This is a simple minded checker written in bison (yacc did work for
the error recovery nicely).  My Makefile is at the end.  Have fun.
