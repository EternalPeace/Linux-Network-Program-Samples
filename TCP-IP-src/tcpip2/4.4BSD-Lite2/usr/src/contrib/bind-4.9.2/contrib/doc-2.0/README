UPDATED RELEASE: 2.0.1 (9/12/90)

Includes fixes for two portability bugs:

  1) On some systems (e.g. SunOS 4.1), the shell exit code is an unsigned
     8 bit value.  This differs from the development environment where
     negative values were also returned.  This affected values
     returned by auxiliary files: doc1.awk & doc3.awk.

  2) Some shells did not handle things like "@ cnt2++ " correctly.
     Variable names were changed where appropriate.

=====================================================

Greetings,

This is a the first public release of Doc - Version 2.0.
Doc (domain obscenity control) is a program which diagnoses
misbehaving domains by sending queries off to the appropriate
DNS nameservers, and performing simple analysis on the responses.

IMPORTANT: Doc requires version 2.0 of the DNS query tool `dig`
           (domain internet groper).

Files contained in this distribution:

README       - You're looking at it.
INFO         - Documents current procedure
doc.1        - man page
doc.txt      - ASCII man page
doc          - Shell script for automated domain test
doc1.awk     - simple awk file used by `doc`
doc3.awk     - simple awk file used by `doc`
doc4.awk     - simple awk file used by `doc`
RFC.XXXX     - Draft of RFC about Automated Domain testing
log.isi.edu. - Sample run for isi.edu. domain


Required files NOT in the distribution:

Dig (Version 2.0) - DNS query program required to run `doc`
                    Available via anonymous ftp from:
                    venera.isi.edu.  pub/dig.2.0.tar.Z


SETUP/CONFIGURATION

'Doc' is a csh script, so no complex porting effort will be required.
Other than the first few aliases and pointers to directories that you
will edit in the 'doc' shell file itself, no changes should be necessary.


Doc-V.2.0 is an initial implementation of an automated domain testing
tool.  We expect considerable design modification and implementation
changes to be made as experience is gained through use in the
Internet.  At some point, we expect the design to stabilize and a
production version, implemented in something other than the current
UNIX-tool patchwork, to be released.

Comments and discussion are very much welcome.
