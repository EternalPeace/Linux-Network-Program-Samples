This is a implementation of getnetby{addr,name}() and {set,end}hostent()
that uses the DNS (RFC1101).

We have moved the old versions of getnetby{addr,name}() and
{set,end}hostent() to _getnetby{addr,name}() and _{set,end}hostent().

Our implementation querys the DNS and falls back to the old functions in
the case of a negative reply. This is done since, at this moment, few people
have entered this information in the DNS.

Because of this we have modified the {set,end}netent() functions so now
they turn on or off the resolver options "RES_STAYOPEN | RES_USEVC"
(by calling {set,end}hostent() ) AND open the /etc/networks .

We have made a test program (called nettest) that looks for information
on a network passed in the command line (either by name or by number).

	gnu% ./nettest 192.138.204
	 Official name: net.mat.uc.pt
	 Net addr. type: 2
	 Network :  12618444 ---->   192.138.204
	 Aliases :
	gnu% ./nettest 192.138.204.0
	 Official name: net.mat.uc.pt 
	 Net addr. type: 2 
	 Network :  3230321664 ---->   192.138.204.0  
	 Aliases : 
	gnu% ./nettest net.mat.uc.pt.
	 Official name: net.mat.uc.pt
	 Net addr. type: 2
	 Network :  12618444 ---->   192.138.204
	 Aliases :
	gnu% ./nettest mat.uc.pt
	 Official name: mat.uc.pt
	 Net addr. type: 2
	 Network :  12618444 ---->   192.138.204
	 Aliases :

The program nettest.local uses the functions in libresolv, that usually
read /etc/networks.

The Makefile included can also recompile netstat (if you have the
source to netstat) using these functions.

At this moment this netstat (option -r) is very slow.
It will be better when named caches negative replys and/or
more people enter this information in the DNS.

This has been tested in BSD/386 (0.9.4), in SunOS (4.0.3 and 4.1.3)
and Ultrix 4.2.
NOTE: These versions never use yellow pages (NIS).
