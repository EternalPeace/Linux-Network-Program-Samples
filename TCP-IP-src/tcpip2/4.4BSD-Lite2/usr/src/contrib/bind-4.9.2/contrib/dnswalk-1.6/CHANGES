Version 1.6
removed -c switch, since I thought it would work a long time ago, but
later found out it could never be made to work.  Well, it could, just
not very nicely.  (nor efficiently)

Fixed bug with parsing of dig output.  Newer dig has slightly different
output, causing serial numbers to not be pulled out.

Changed the do-dnswalk script to use exec > logfile instead of
redirecting every invocation to a logfile.  Idea from Dan Ehrlich.

Fixed problem with dnswalk using old list of subdomains in axfr file,
ignoring the new zone transfer if it was needed.

Accounted for annoying behavior of new dig to print duplicate SOA's.

Documented nameserver error reporting.

Version 1.5

added -F switch.  This performs "fascist" checking.  For every A record,
it checks to see that it actually points to the canonical name listed
for the PTR and reports mismatches.  Try this switch at least once to see
what kind of things pop up.  (You may be surprised)

added -m switch.  Performs check on zone only if it has been modified
(serial number changed) since the previous run.

changed format of messages to be shorter and more precise.  (and hopefully
easier to read)  Read the README section for a full description.

warns if a zone has only one authoratative nameserver
*** in later versions of 1.3, not posted here, but available for ftp,
there was a bad bug which caused erroneous warnings about having only
one nameserver.  (was using the wrong variable)

reports any errors listed in dig zone transfer output.  (usually
caused by a corrupted zone file, or invalid syntax in data; for example
only one field in an HINFO record.)

now reports any resolver errors from gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.
(for example, a server timeout, connection refused, etc)

sorts output by zone (correctly -- some versions of 1.3 didn't quite do
this right)

displays server of authority and zone contact for each zone it checks.

I've now included a 'do-dnswalk' script that is an example wrapper
that I use around dnswalk to turn on status debugging and put the
results in a log file.  Salt to taste.
