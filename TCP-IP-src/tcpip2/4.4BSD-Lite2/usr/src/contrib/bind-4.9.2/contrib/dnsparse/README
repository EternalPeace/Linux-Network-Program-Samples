In this directory are some tools for manipulating Domain Name System
master files, and for converting to /etc/hosts format.  There are also
a couple of tools (simphosts, sorthosts) for dealing with host tables.

To run dns2hosts, or anything which uses the dnsparse.pl library
(currently just dnstest and dnsmkptr), one must first compile
"dnslex.c" into a program "dnslex" and install it somewhere in your
search path.  The "dnsparse.pl" file must also be somewhere in the
perl library search path, and perl must be available.

Typically how one generates new host table(s) from the DNS zone files is
to have the zones and their master file pathnames in "zonelist", and
then do something like (in csh syntax):

set ver=YY.MM.DD
foreach dom ( ogi admin.ogi cbs.ogi cse.ogi ese.ogi mse.ogi )
  echo $dom
  set fil="HOSTS.${dom}.$ver"
  ./dns2hosts -d${dom}.edu `cat zonelist` > $fil
  chmod a-w,a+r $fil
end

NOTE: you may need to edit by hand to reorder multiply-homed hosts!

To Do:

Write some real documentation.  Manual pages, too.

The dnsmkptr program is really simplistic -- needs to produce split
zone files (net/subnet), rather than just a single output.

These things should really be more automated....

The dns2hosts output would be "more like the nameserver" if it also
simulated the "sortlist" functionality.  This would require another
option to specify the target network that queries are coming from,
and maybe also the home network.  Complicated, ugly, and at the least
it requires further study.
