How to add new hosts to the name server data base:

1) Edit 'named.hosts' file:

	For each machine you need to enter the following information:
	machine name, all its network addresses, host information, and common
	aliases for it.

	This is the entry for calder.

CALDER		IN	A	128.32.130.1
		IN	A	128.32.129.3
		IN	HINFO	VAX-11/750 UNIX
UCBCALDER	IN	CNAME	CALDER

 For the machine you are adding:
	1) replace 'CALDER' with the new machine name
	2) replace '128.32.130.1' with the new machines address
		if there is more then one address for the machine
		then add lines like the one with '128.32.129.3'
	3) replace 'VAX-11/750' with the machine type
	4) If it doesn't run 'UNIX' then replace UNIX with its
	   operating system.

2) Edit 'named.rev' file:

	For each address of a machine you need to enter the reverse
	address notation for the machine:

	For calder the lines look as follows:

12.0	IN	PTR	CALDER.BERKELEY.EDU.
3.129	IN	PTR	CALDER.BERKELEY.EDU.

	Calder has two address '128.32.0.12' and '128.32.129.3'

	You take the two numbers after 128.32 and reverse them.
	Then replace CALDER with the new machine name.

    *** Note the trailing "." on "EDU." it needs to be there.  Otherwise
	BIND will add the current $ORIGIN to this name, which won't work.
	***

3) Increment the serial number on both files.
