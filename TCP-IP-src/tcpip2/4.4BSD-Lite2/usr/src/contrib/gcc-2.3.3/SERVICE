GNU Service Directory				-*- text -*-

This is a list of people who have asked to be listed as offering
support services for GNU software, including GNU Emacs, for a fee
or in some cases at no charge.

The information comes from the people who asked to be listed;
we do not include any information we know to be false, but we
cannot check out any of the information; we are transmitting it to
you as it was given to us and do not promise it is correct.
Also, this is not an endorsement of the people listed here.
We have no opinions and usually no information about the abilities of
any specific person.  We provide this list to enable you to contact
service providers and decide for yourself whether to hire one.

Before FSF will list your name in the GNU Service Directory, we ask
that you agree informally to the following terms:

1. You will not restrict (except by copyleft) the use or distribution
of any software, documentation, or other information you supply anyone
in the course of modifying, extending, or supporting GNU software.
This includes any information specifically designed to ameliorate the
use of GNU software.

2. You will not take advantage of contact made through the Service
Directory to advertise an unrelated business (e.g., sales of
non-GNU-related proprietary information).  You may spontaneously
mention your availability for general consulting, but you should not
promote a specific unrelated business unless the client asks.

Please include some indication of your rates, because otherwise users
have nothing to go by.	Please put each e-mail address inside "<>".
Please put nothing else inside "<>".  Thanks!

For a current copy of this directory, or to have yourself listed, ask:

Programs: Gnu Emacs Ada Mode, Gnu Emacs Empire Tool, Emacs,
	g++ and gnumake (limited support only).

Experiance:
  Gnu Emacs Ada Mode	-- Co-author, principle integrator
  Gnu Emacs Empire Tool -- Originator, co-author, principle distributor
  Emacs -- Almost all parts. Authored super-apropos, headers, first GDB
	   interface, fancy-lisp, enhanced scribe mode,and lots of small stuff
  g++	-- Have maintained, modified, and used G++ on 300+ user commercial
	   OLTP software.
  gnumake -- Have bug fixed and extended.

  Have single makefile that can merge in local changes and build the
  following systems in a consistent manner in multiple releases on multiple
  machines:
    asm, bison, gcc, g++, emacs, rcs, gdb, libg++, att c++ libs, gnumake,
    diff, tex2iroff
  The makefile and related techniques are a bit hard to explain, but they
  enable use and local changes in a broad spectrum of FSF code on many
  platforms without having to remember all the individual make procedures.

Rate:  Free for good cause or short stuff as there is time.
  Am most likely to help in areas in which I have had problems or expect to
  have problems.
