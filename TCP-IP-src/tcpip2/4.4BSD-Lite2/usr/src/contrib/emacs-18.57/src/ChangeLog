	* process.c (wait_reading_process_input):
	Use only detect_input_pending to check for pending kbd input.

	kbd input; it could be an expose event.)

	any global variables.

	* ymakefile (alloca.o): Copy sed output to a .s file and use cc

	This reverses a change made on Jan 28 which was described then

	was exactly the opposite.  The truth is that anciently the
	`fstat' was after, and on Jan 28 it was moved before.

	* window.c (F{set,current}_window_configuration):
	New lisp-callable functions which do the guts of
	Fsave_window_excursion.

	Also fixed a bug in which point was not being restored in

	was not current when the config was recorded (It is supposed
	to not be restored if it was current at the start)

	* alloc.c (mark_object):
	Add case for Lisp_Window_Configuration; remove code for
	Lisp_Temp_vector.

	* window.c, window.h:

	* keyboard.c, minibuf.c: Window configuration caller changes.

	* print.c (print):
	Understand Lisp_Window_Configuration's.

	Status strings "open" and "closed" replace "run" and "exit"
	for tcp connections only.  New function Fopen_network_stream.

	* dired.c (Ffile_attributes): Use XINT to store the inode #.

	against hscroll.  This caused window_end_pos to be wrong
	when there was hscroll.

	* xdisp.c (display_text_line): Move code that inserts `$'
	at bol for hscroll, so that its alteration of p1 does not
	interfere with setting point_hpos.

	is truncation.

	* xdisp.c (display_string): mincol==-1 means no minimum.

Sat Feb  7 20:12:23 1987  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* window.c (Fnext_window): Restore old meaning of t as 2nd arg:
	count minibuffer window even if not active.
	Non-t-non-nil as 2nd arg means never count minibuffer window.

	* unexec.c (make_hdr): New var `bss_end' holds end-of-bss address.
	This simplifies computation of bss size while keeping it from
	being negative.

Fri Jan 23 08:56:56 1987  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* fileio.c (Fexpand_file_name):
	Have to do checks for "//" "/~" etc even if filename is
	non-absolute, otherwise things like "~user1/~user2" aren't

	* search.c (Freplace_match): Change declaration `char' to `int'.

	* window.c (all functions): Add register declarations.

	* window.c (Fsave_window_excursion):
	Don't gcpro the saved window status.  The specpdl does it.

Tue Dec 23 16:50:06 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	window_end_valid appropriately as well.

	* process.c (wait_reading_process_input):

	If `suspend-emacs-hook' returns t don't suspend
	-- assume the hook did the equivalent of `suspending' for us
	(including calling suspend-resume-hook if necessary.)

	In DoDsp, rearrange the tests to see whether to use cached
	line info to be a little faster.
	Fix some bugs in which cursX and cursY might not be updated
	correctly when using cached info (needed to add this_line_hpos
	variable to do this correctly)
	(Added unnecessary gotos and  label `cancel' for added readability)

	* fns.c (Fy_or_n_p):
	Move cursor to start of line after reading answer so

Tue Dec 16 01:05:16 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* alloc.c: New garbage collection technique for strings.

	Strings that have string blocks individually allocated
	are called "large strings".  Other strings are called "small".

	The string blocks for small strings are now chained both ways and
	there is a pointer to the oldest one of them in `first_string_block'.
	The string blocks for large strings are chained only from the
	latest to the oldest, and the latest is in `large_string_blocks'.

	Garbage collection starts by setting MARKBIT in the `size' of
	each large string.  This allows mark_object to distinguish them.
	MARKBIT in string sizes is cleared by gc_sweep.

	Large strings are freed individually by GC, like vectors.
	Those in use are marked with ARRAY_MARK_FLAG in the `size' field.

	Small strings are relocated, compressing them within their
	string blocks.  
	mark_object puts all slots that point at a string onto a chain
	which runs from the string's `size' field, through all the slots
	that used to point at the string.  The end of the chain is shown
	by a number that is small enough to be a small string's length.

	This new technique avoids calling malloc during GC.  Thus, there
	is no danger of fatal error on exhausting memory.  Also, space
	needed for strings is cut in half.

	The new technique introduces a potential for bugs, however.
	If any slot is marked twice--for example, if it is GCPRO'd
	twice by different functions--and it contains a string,
	the ref chain of the string may become garbled.  Sometimes
	it will still work!  This is because a slot that's part of a
	string's ref chain will look like a Lisp_Int if the next thing
	in the chain is malloc'd memory.  But this will not win if the
	next thing in the chain is a stack slot, or if malloc'd data
	lives high up in memory.

	To avoid this problem, MARKBIT is used in stack slots
	to prevent double marking.

	* bytecode.c (Fbytecode): Adjustment of gcpro1.nvars before
	call to Ffuncall was off by one.

	* alloc.c (make_uninit_string): make_zero_string renamed as this
	and no longer zeros the contents.
	* alloc.c (Fmake_string): initialize string contents.

	* alloc.c (struct string_block): Now chained both ways thru
	`next' and `prev' fields.  `first_string_block' exists.
	Strings with individual string blocks are now called "large"
	and these string blocks go in a separate chain which starts
	from `large_string_blocks' and runs via `prev' fields only.

	* alloc.c: Stop using clear_marks.  Make gc_sweep clear
	the marks on all live objects.
	
	* alloc.c (malloc_warning, Fgarbage_collect): Eliminate mechanism
	that defers malloc warnings during GC, since GC no longer calls
	malloc.

	* fns.c: Fding requires an arg; pass Qnil.

	* m-alliant.h: define TEXT_START as 0x1000.
	Don't define LIBS_STANDARD; the default (sharable) library
	is said to work now.

	* alloc.c (mark_object): Now pass address of slot being marked.
	mark_object itself can alter the slot when necessary.
	It now returns no value.  All callers changed to pass the address.

	mark_object can now ignore the mark bit if it's set in the slot.
	Callers need no longer make a copy in which mark bit is clear.
	mark_object can clear the mark bit so these callers must still
	set the mark bit again after calling mark_object on such slots.

Mon Dec 15 21:25:18 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (create_process): TIOCNOTTY needs no 3rd arg after all.
	* sysdep.c (set_exclusive_use): ditto for FIOCLEX.

	* emacs.c (Fdump_emacs): [ALLIANT]
	Copy _curbrk into save_curbrk, not vice versa.

Sat Dec 13 02:32:47 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* sysdep.c (flush_pending_output): 3rd arg to TIOCFLUSH
	now is address of word containing zero.  It matters.

	* editfns.c (Fformat): Fix another error in previous bug.

Fri Dec 12 10:34:02 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

Thu Dec 11 17:43:44 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keyboard.c (Fsuspend_emacs): Pass no args to the
	suspend-resume-hook.  Also call a new hook, `suspend-hook',
	before suspending.

	* search.c (search_buffer): In inner loop of BM search,
	decide dynamically whether signed or unsigned comparison
	of p_limit vs cursor will give the right results
	and use the kind that will work.

Thu Dec 11 12:17:31 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* emacs.c,  dispnew.c:
	Rename inhibit_x_windows inhibit_window_system.
	Understand "-nw" command-line option.
	Reorganise init_display a little to make other window-system
	code easier to accommodate.

	* editfns.c (Fformat):
	Move the increment of the number of args the format string wants.
	Share code for various kinds of arguments converted to strings.

Wed Dec 10 17:42:20 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* commands.h: Declare cursor_in_echo_area.
	* dispnew.c (init_display): initialize it.
	* dispnew.c (syms_of_display): make Lisp variable for it.
	* dispnew.c (update_screen): If cursor_in_echo_area not 0,
	set cursor position after last char on last screen line.
	* fns.c (Fy_or_n_p): Set cursor_in_echo_area while read answer.

	* data.c (Fset_default): if RTPC_REGISTER_BUG defined,
	don't declare `b' register.
	* m-ibmrt.h: Define RTPC_REGISTER_BUG.

	* print.c (print, case Lisp_Window):

	Declare printcharfun register.

Tue Dec  9 10:46:18 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* editfns.c (Fformat):
	`%%' doesn't take an `arg'

	* doc.c (Fsubstitute_command_keys):
	Fix stupid mistakes and errors.  Rename many local variables
	and rearrange some code.

Sun Dec  7 16:42:44 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xfns.c (Fx_flip_color):
	Missing paren in DEFUN arglist.

Sat Dec  6 13:17:57 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* Version 18.32 released.

	* process.c ({read,handle}_process_output):
	Combine handle_process_output into read_process_output.
	Check for case where read returns -1.

Fri Dec  5 02:30:37 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (read_process_output): Read only one buffer worth
	and return without trying to read more.  It used to loop
	until all output was gobbled.  Now some callers do this loop
	but not all of them.

	* process.c (change_msgs): Call read_process_output repeatedly
	until it returns 0 (no chars were read).

	* term.c (write_chars): loop counting repeated chars leaves
	p at second nonrepeated char.  Decrement p after the loop.

	* process.c (create_process): Use set_exclusive_use;
	don't use FIOCLEX directly.

	* sysdep.c (flush_pending_output):
	Pass a valid address as third arg to TIOCFLUSH, just in case.
	* sysdep.c (set_exclusive_use): Likewise, with FIOCLEX.
	* process.c (create_process): Likewise, with TIOCNOTTY.

	* xfns.c (XCleanUp): Pass Qt to Fdo_auto_save.

	* xfns.c (Fx_rubber_band): Set screen_garbaged.

	* doc.c (Fsubstitute_command_keys):
	Use Fwhere_is_internal instead of where_is_in_buffer.
	New construct =<MAPVAR> means use value of MAPVAR
	as local map when calling Fwhere_is_internal.

	* keymap.c (Fwhere_is_internal, where_is_in_buffer):
	Combine the two functions.  This adds two arguments to
	Fwhere_is_internal: KEYMAP and FIRSTONLY.
	To get the old behavior, KEYMAP must be (current-local-map).
	Therefore, KEYMAP is a mandatory operand for Lisp callers.

	* keymap.c (Fwhere_is): Pass new args to Fwhere_is_internal.
	* keymap.c (apropos1): Call Fwhere_is_internal instead of
	where_is_in_buffer.

	* search.c (Freplace_match): Check type of first arg.

	* abbrev.c (Fexpand_abbrev): For abbrev with hook,
	run the hook in addition to (and following) insertion
	of the expansion in the usual way.

	* editfns.c (Fformat): [MLY]
	Compute number of args needed by format string; then
	convert args from Lisp_Object to int or char *, defaulting
	any not specified.

	Don't GCPRO; should not be needed since eval is not called.

	* editfns.c (format1): Args are ints or char *'s,
	not Lisp_Objects.  Call them ints.

Thu Dec  4 17:54:21 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xfns.c (Fx_debug):
	Return Lisp_Object

Mon Dec  1 16:10:38 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xfns.c (Fx_set_font):
	Don't die if font is ""  (I believe this to be an X bug)
	Also, add interactive specs for Fx_set_(internal_)border_width.

	* lread.c (oblookup):
	Don't core-dump if data in obarray is invalid

Mon Dec  1 08:32:13 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* m-att3b.h: on 3b2, 3b5 and 3b15, #define C_OPTIMIZE_SWITCH null
	since -O triggers compiler bug affecting push_key_description.

Fri Nov 28 14:02:07 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* keyboard.c (read_key_sequence):
	Delay setting up the local vars pointing to keymaps until a
	character has been read.  This is in order that a change of keymap
	`behind our back' (eg due to a subprocesses action) will be seen.

	* xterm.c:
	Typo.

Wed Nov 26 04:18:46 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* sysdep.c (get_system_name):
	 Eliminate internal static var in USG case.

	* lisp.h: New case testing and conversion macros
	UPPERCASEP, LOWERCASEP, NOCASEP, UPCASE, DOWNCASE.
	They all work from downcase_table.

	* casefiddle.c (casify_object, casify_region):
	Use those macros.  Create an enum type for the flags
	and change the flag names to avoid conflict with the macros.

	* abbrev.c (Fexpand_abbrev): Use those macros.
	* editfns.c (init_editfns):
	* fns.c (y-or-n-p):
	* keymap.c (access_keymap):
	* fileio.c (report_file_error):
	* process.c (change_msgs):

	* search.c (Freplace_match): Use upcase_initials_region
	insead of duplicating it.

	* keyboard.c (Frecursive_edit): If not the top-level edit,
	specbind standard-output and standard-input to t.
	* keyboard.c (command_loop_1): Don't set those two vars.
	This avoids clobbering them permanently when minibuffer is used.

Tue Nov 25 02:52:36 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* callproc.c (child_setup): New arg `envlen' is length
	of the list Vprocess_extra_environment.
	This list's elements (strings) are put at the front of
	the environment for the other program.

	* callproc.c (Fcall_process): Some rearrangement of
	local variables for more register decls.  Compute
	and pass `envlen' arg to child_setup.

	* process.c (create_process):  Compute and pass `envlen' arg
	to child_setup.

	* xterm.c (x_term_init): Don't call XPopUpWindow at all.
	Leave it for the term-setup-hook (see lisp/term/x-win.el).

	* keyboard.c (syms_of_keyboard):
	Delete defsubr for usg-suspend-emacs.

	* fns.c, m-masscomp.h: Rename MASSCOMP_REGISTER_BUG
	to MASSC_REGISTER_BUG to avoid shortnames confusion on V.0.

	* dispnew.c (direct_output_for_{self_insert,forward_char}):
	These functions now return 0 if did nothing or 1 if did display.
	* keyboard.c (command_loop_1): Notice the returned values.

	* window.c (change_window_height):
	Add new variable delta1 so no need to use delta
	for two different things.
	Making window bigger to equal its parent's size used to crash.
	Fix it by different way of computing delta1 in that case.
	Move some variable decls to inner blocks and add "register".

Mon Nov 24 14:09:52 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.h: `modtime' field = 0 now means no info on visited file.
	Nonexistent visited file now represented by -1.

	* fileio.c (Fverify_visited_file_modtime):
	Adjust for changed meaning of `modtime'.

	* fileio.c (Finsert_file_contents):
	If visiting and file doesn't exist, finish visiting (updating
	various buffer slots) before getting error, and set modtime to -1.

	* bytecode.c (Fbytecode): Rarrange all the Bvarref cases to
	share most of the code.  Likewise for Bvarset, Bvarbind
	and Bunbind cases.  Makes it smaller and makes all
	Bvarrefs use the fast inline code.

	* keymap.c (Fdefine_key, Flookup_key):
	Regard chars 0200 and up as equivalent to 2 char sequences
	starting with meta_prefix_char.

	* search.c (search_buffer and callers):

	algorithm.  Meaning of returned value changed.
	* search.c (bcmp_buffer_translated): No longer used; deleted.

	* search.c (ScanBf, scan_buffer): complete rewrite of ScanBf
	and nearly all is now in scan_buffer, a new function.
	* cmds.c (Fforward_line): Complete rewrite; now calls scan_buffer.

	* search.c (Fscan_buffer): Delete this.
	* bytecode.c (Fbytecode): Just get error if Bscan_buffer is used.

	* ymakefile: Rename TEXT_START_ADDR to LD_TEXT_START_ADDR
	to avoid shortname trouble (ymakefile is processed thru
	the system's cpp).

	* sysdep.c (init_sys_modes): Change #ifdef USG to #ifdef _IOFBF
	around the call to setvbuf.

	* sysdep.c (bcopy): declare it to return int
	so that a forward declaration is not needed
	so there is no problem defining it as a macro.

	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region): Don't try fsync on 4.1bsd.

Sun Nov 23 00:04:19 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* eval.c (record_unwind_protect, specbind, unbind_to, Funbind_protect):
	struct specbind now has a new slot `func'.  An internal
	unwind-protect stores the C function address there; else it's 0.
	Lisp_Internal_Function data type no longer used.
	Result is no more dependency on where in the address space
	function addresses are found.

	* xterm.c (x_term_init): Better message if server does not
	respond.

	* version 18.31 released.

	* xterm.c, xfns.c (Vxterm1): Lisp var `xterm' now points at
	Vxterm1, which is initialized like Vxterm but never examined.

	* xterm.c (XTread_socket): Use C-x C-@ to indicate mouse click.

Sat Nov 22 02:21:56 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* bytecode.c (Fbytecode): Turn on immediate_quit for Bnth loop.

	* keymap.c (Fcurrent_global_map): New function
	that returns the current global map.

	* emacs.c (main, Fdump_emacs): [ALLIANT] save _curbrk
	before dumping and restore when starting dumped Emacs.

	* process.c (wait_reading_process_input):
	[ALLIANT] if select returns with EFAULT, just set Available = 0.
	[always] copy errno right after the select and check the copy
	in case another system call could alter it in between.

	* m-alliant.h, m-mg1.h: New machines supported.

	* ymakefile: Make START_FILES a preprocesser variable
	and don't change it if already defined.
	* m-gould.h: Move special gould value of START_FILES here.

	* fileio.c (syms_of_fileio): Define variable vms-stmlf-recfm.
	* sysdep.c (sys_creat): If vms_stmlf_recfm is nonzero,
	create new files with rfm=stmlf.

Thu Nov 20 17:07:14 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* eval.c (unbind_catch): Don't ref thru handlerlist if null.

	* keyboard.c (Fusg_suspend_emacs): Delete this.
	* sysdep.c (sys_suspend): Put in USG_JOBCTRL
	method of suspending with ptrace.

Wed Nov 19 06:45:23 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* xterm.c (x_term_init): Delete attempt to set up
	a handler for SIGIO.  This was normally overridden in
	init_keyboard so it didn't matter; but this handler
	is invalid, so it crashed if it ever did get called.

	* indent.c (compute_motion): Fix screwy #if celerity || ATT3B
	which is invalid.

Tue Nov 18 17:59:57 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keyboard.c (command_loop_1):
	Must check to reselect buffer and flush minibuf message
	before trying fast_read_single_key.  Else have lossage
	typing printing chars when minibuf message is displayed.

	* keyboard.c (Fsuspend_emacs):
	Execute suspend-resume-hook value on resumption.

	* lisp.h: Make initialized global.
	* data.c (init_data): Undo last change; not needed now.

Tue Nov 18 15:19:06 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* dispnew.c (window_change_signal):
	New function to handle SIGWINCH, defined only if SIGWINCH is.
	Turned on in init_display if CANNOT_DUMP or if initialized.

	* data.c (init_data), editfns.c (init_editfns):
	Test initialized, not Vpurify_flag.  Use explicit
	conditionals to avoid the test when CANNOT_DUMP.

Mon Nov 17 00:19:06 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.c (Ferase_buffer): Zero the buffer's save_length.
	Future text after erase is unrelated to past text
	so should not suspend auto saving if future text is smaller.

	* buffer.c (init_buffer_once):
	Was passing entire structure to bzero; now pass address.

	* fns.c: Prevent warning in 4.3 where param.h does #define BSD

Sun Nov 16 12:56:21 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* dispnew.c (init_display): Set window-system to symbol x, not "X".

	* xfns.c (grey_p): Insert missing commas.
	* emacs.c (main): Fix typo "ihhibit_x_windows".

	* xterm.c (x_term_init): Delay calling XPopUpWindow
	till after Vxterm is set.  Also must include lisp.h.
	Also always set Vxterm if CANNOT_DUMP.

	* xfns.c, xterm.c: Include signal.h before xterm.h
	because on 4.3 both of them define sigmask
	and only xterm.h considers the case that it is already defined.

	* buffer.h: Add BufferSafeCeiling and BufferSafeFloor.

	* process.c (Fprocess_send_eof):
	Now has conditional on DID_REMOTE, which is defined
	if TIOCREMOTE is actually used.

Sat Nov 15 00:53:26 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* Emacs version 18.30 *

	* xdisp.c (display_string):
	Change minwidth and maxwidth args to mincol and maxcol:
	minimum and maximum absolute hpos to end at.
	Change all callers (all in xdisp).

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_element)
	Similar change of minwidth and maxwidth args.
	This permits considerable internal simplification
	and deletion of the function display_mode_element_1.

	* xdisp.c (decode_mode_spec): Flush unused arg minwidth.
	Change call (in display_mode_element).

Fri Nov 14 12:52:51 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (create_process): Don't get a pty
	if the new variable Vprocess_connection_type is not t.
	This is the Lisp variable process-connection-type.

Thu Nov 13 18:46:32 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* crt0.c: Rename GLOBAL_START_{DOT,NO_DOT}
	to {DOT,NODOT}_GLOBAL_START to avoid shortnames trouble.
	* m-vax.h, m-tahoe.h, m-sequent.h: same change.

	* m-att3b.h: Turn off #define VIRT_ADDR_VARIES
	(kk says no need for it).

	* keyboard.c (Fcommand_execute):
	Zero debug_on_next_call before running the command.

Wed Nov 12 10:19:31 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* data.c (Fsequencep):
	(sequencep nil) => t

	* xdisp.c (display_string):
	Put a "|" at end of mode-lines of partial-width windows.

	* xdisp.c (various):
	mode-line-format %259 means to pad field to 259, but not to
	truncate it.
	(259 . <format>) also means to pad.
	(-259 . <format>) means to truncate to 259, but not to pad.
	[So (-259 . (259 . x)) means to format x -exactly- 259 chars wide.]

	* dispnew.c (Fding):
	Do not terminate macro-definition if given an argument
	(This is so things like asynchronous process notifications
	can beep but not screw)

Mon Nov 10 16:32:08 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (Fset_file_modes): [APOLLO] must reset
	modtime after changing the modes.

	* xdisp.c (display_string): Measure new line length
	from start of line body.

	Do not use XFASTINT on `next' fields of symbols.
	Fix incorrect sense of test for end of bucket.

	* filelock.c (current_file_owner):
	Fix incorrect sense of test with `kill'
	for death of previous locker.

	* keyboard.c (get_char):
	Arg of -1 now means don't do redisplay.
	Rearrange conditionals so detect_input_pending is not called
	in certain cases.

	* keyboard.c (read_key_sequence):
	New arg nodisplay, nonzero means pass -1 to 1st call to get_char.

	* keyboard.c (command_loop_1):
	After a command that does direct screen updating,
	if buffer_shared is not more than 1,
	pass 1 for nodisplay to read_key_sequence.

	* minibuf.c (Fminibuffer_depth): New function returns
	value of MinibufDepth as a Lisp Int.

	* dired.c (Ffile_attributes): Return inode # as element 10.

	* dispnew.c (update_line):
	Fix bug that noop'd the attempt to let new explicit spaces
	match the implicit space past end of old line.
	Also do not ignore trailing spaces in a highlighted line;
	instead, give it more trailing spaces so it reaches the margin.

Sat Nov  8 20:55:04 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* data.c (init_data): Don't call signal if purifying.
	* ymakefile: Stop using gould-sigvec.s.

	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region): APOLLO is now like VMS
	in doing the stat after the close.

	* emacs.c (main): If APOLLO, don't call malloc_init.
	We use the system's malloc on the Apollo.

	* editfns.c (init_editfns):
	If CANNOT_DUMP, do all the work, regardless of Vpurify_flag.

	* alloc.c (mark_object): If not SWITCH_ENUM_BUG

	* process.c (pty): [HPUX] Do TIOCREMOTE.

	* unexec.c (makehdr): Code to adjust, default and validate
	data_start and bss_start now common to COFF and non-COFF cases.

	* unexec.c (makehdr): Param SEGMENT_MASK controls rounding of
	memory-address of text-data boundary (default is pagemask).
	[COFF only] SECTION_ALIGNMENT controls rounding of file addresses
	of section beginnings; default is no rounding.
	[non-COFF] ADJUST_EXEC_HEADER is hook to be executed
	before filling in a_text, etc. of the header.

	With these parameters, all known machines can be handled
	with no special conditionals.

	* m-sun1.h, m-sun2.h, m-isi-ov.h: Define SEGMENT_MASK.
	* m-stride.h, m-nu.h, s-umax.h: Define SECTION_ALIGNMENT.
	* m-masscomp.h, m-gould.h, s-hpux.h: Define ADJUST_EXEC_HEADER.
	* m-gould.h: Define A_TEXT_OFFSET = sizeof (hdr)

	* unexec.c (makehdr): Remove ibmrt conditionals
	that adjusted a_text or equivalent, by just copying from
	the old file when NO_REMAP.

	* unexec.c (makehdr): Zero supplied as entry_address
	means copy it from the old file.
	* emacs.c (Fdump_emacs): Pass 0 as entry_address to unexec.

	* unexec.c (copy_text_and_data):
	Two fixes for A_TEXT_OFFSET case:
	Don't decrement `end', and remove (unconditionally)
	the lseek before writing the data segment.

	* keymap.c (apropos1): Use Fdocumentation_property, not Fget,
	for doc strings of variables.

Wed Nov  5 18:47:41 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* m-att3b.h:
	#define TEXT_START 0

Wed Nov  5 12:42:38 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* alloc.c (Fcons, Fmake_symbol, Fmake_marker, gc_sweep):
	The free-list pointers in symbols, conses and markers
	are now C pointers cast as ints and stored in the XFASTINT.
	This may make faster code and in any case avoids problems
	with machines where access with XPNTR relocates the pointer.

	* lread.c (oblookup, map_obarray):
	Use XFASTINT when comparing a Lisp_Object against zero.

	* minibuf.c (read_minibuf):
	If noninteractive, print the prompt, since
	it won't be displayed in the normal way.
	In any case, pass Fread the string rather than a buffer
	when reading an s-expression.

	* auxdoc.c, callint.c, syntax.c, ymakefile:
	Copy fake-DEFUNs from auxdoc.c into comments
	preceding the real DEFUNs for the same functions.
	auxdoc.c is no longer in use.

	* fileio.c (Fread_file_name_internal):
	[VMS only] Return t if file name is null string.

Tue Nov  4 14:00:34 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.c (Fget_buffer_create):
	For default-major-mode = nil case, use fundamental-mode
	if old buffer's mode name has a non-nil mode-class property.
	Requires creating Qmode_class to hold the symbol mode-class.

	* s-hpux.h: #undef HAVE_PTYS because of problems with
	scheme running as an inferior on a pty.
	jinx@prep requested this.

	* lread.c (check_obarray & its callers): eliminate 2nd arg.
	Also, don't confuse types int and Lisp_Object.
	If invalid value matches Vobarray, store a valid Vobarray.

	* editfns.c (Fformat): Don't use an initialization for tem
	since it is a Lisp_Object and that can be a struct.

	* minibuf.c (Ftry_completion, Fall_completions):
	Use XFASTINT when testing `bucket' for nonzero or
	setting it to zero.

	* callint.c (Fcall_interactively): If visargs[i] is nil,
	don't try to reference it as a string.

	* doc.c (FSnarf_dcumentation):
	Was assuming exec-path was a string.  Fixed to use
	exec-directory instead, and to validate its data type first.

Tue Nov  4 10:06:24 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* m-isi.h => m-isi-ov.h

Tue Nov  4 09:08:52 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.c (init_buffer_once):
	Avoid casts from int to Lisp_Object (which would lose
	if NO_UNION_TYPE is not defined); use XFASTINT.

Mon Nov  3 16:36:03 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xterm.c (stufflines):
	Initialise signal mask.

	* xterm.h:
	Add definition of sigmask

	#undef sun2 ? #define sun3

	* termcap.c:
	Include Dave Genzel @ Unilogic's VMS termcap stuff.

	* termcap.c:
	#ifdef emacs ? #include config.h

	* fileio.c, fns.c, m-vax.h:
	Fixes for VMS cpp. (#undef foo -> #ifdef foo ? #undef foo)

Fri Oct 31 23:35:29 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* vmsmakefile (new file)

	* crt0.c, unexec.c, m-isi.h (new file):
	Integrated Solutions 68k port.

Thu Oct 30 01:08:45 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* m-vax.h (USG-only changes):
	#define NO_REMAP (I don't understand exactly why one needs to do
	this -- is there an unexec bug?)
	#define TEXT_START = 0, since C code can't access `start' symbol.

	* lisp.h, sysdep.c, indent.c, m-att3b.h:
	USG and att3bxxx changes from karl@ohio-state.arpa
	Define NO_REMAP, undefine LD_SWITCH_MACHINE

	* buffer.c (Fbuffer_local_variables):
	Return correct values when buffer is selected-buffer

	* keyboard.c (cmd_error):
	non-zero exit status on error.

	* filelock.c:
	Don't get MPV if buffer-file-name isn't a string or nil.

Wed Oct 29 10:18:39 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* keymap.c (Flookup_key, Fdefine_key):
	Don't bomb on zero-length strings.

	* filelock.c (Ffile_locked_p):
	New function.

	* window.c (Fset_window_hscroll):
	Don't inhibit redisplay optimisations if hscroll is same.

	* ymakefile:
	rm ../etc/DOC to avoid make-docfile overwriting any files which
	were linked to it (unix sucks)

Tue Oct 28 00:12:50 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* vmsmap.c, termcap.c, sysdep.c, config.h-dist:
	VMS changes from Sasaki

	Make sure `indirect' initialised.

	* xfns.c (grey_p and callers):
	New function to compensate for ugly chauvinistic American
	spelling.

	* keymap.c (describe_*):
	Don't mention keys in global map which are shadowed by
	local bindings

	Eschew ^#if.*defined (for VMS' sake)

	* keymap.c (Fkeymapp, Flookup_key):
	Add QUIT test.

Mon Oct 27 18:46:08 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* callproc.c, fileio.c:
	VMS changes (make environ noshare, don't call fsync)

Sun Oct 26 00:28:02 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* sysdep.c, unexec.c, ymakefile:
	Gould changes. (marick%cthulhu@gswd-vms.ARPA)

	* gould-sigvec.s:
	New file.

	* m-gould.h:
	New file (for utx/32 2.0 and above)
	Old file renamed m-ogould.h.  See etc/MACHINES
	for more information.

	* unexec.c (make_hdr):
	Typo "#ifdef A_TXT_OFFSET" should be "A_TEXT_OFFSET"	

Wed Oct 22 19:06:41 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* keyboard.c, keymap.c:
	Move Fexecute_extended_command from keymap.c to keyboard.c rather
	than make kludgy static vars global.

	In Fexecute_extended_command record `(this-command-keys)' and
	`last-command' accurately.

	* emacs.c (main), dispnew.c (init_display):
	Add -nx flag, meaning to inhibit X windows and just run in the
	current virtual terminal.  (Perhaps there should be a generic flag
	to disable any special window-system code)
	Add Vwindow_system variable.

	* search.c (Fstring_match):
	Do range-checking on `start' argument.

Tue Oct 21 11:33:40 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xterm.c, xfns.c (x_term_init, x_change_display):
	Share command code, and make that code use
	{request,unrequest,init}_sigio

	* term.c (init_display):
	Determine whether we are under X by whether DISPLAY env var is
	set, not by whether TERM is "xterm"

	* xterm.c (x_term_init):
	Remove (if (!initialized) ...) test.
	Set Vxterm directly, rather than calling setxterm (flush latter)

	* lread.c (various):
	Changes for when can't take XSYMBOL of 0 and to make check_obarray
	code work correctly.

Mon Oct 20 18:05:16 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* m-stride.h, process.c, sysdep.c, unexec.c:
	Stride changes.

Sat Oct 18 16:35:26 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* buffer.c:
	Made default-major-mode same as (default-value 'major-mode) to
	avoid user confusion.

Fri Oct 17 01:51:40 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* cmd.c, process.c:
	Doc fixes from sjk 

	* buffer.c (init_buffer_once):
	Do x = (Lisp_Object) 1 instead of (int) x = 1 for benefit of vms
	and pyramid compilers.

	* minibuf.c (Ftry_completion):
	Test (bucket), not (XSYMBOL (bucket)) since Lisp_Objects may not
	be able to be 0 on some implementations.

	* editfns.c (Fformat):
	Have to duplicate doprnt's work of decoding the
	format-string top ensure that don't die on (format "%s" 0)
	Also, use prin1-to-string to get PR for random objects

	* m-celerity.h:
	HAVE_ALLOCA

Thu Oct 16 20:01:55 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* m-att3b.h:
	New file -- replaces m-3b20.h

	* alloca.c, fileio.c, indent.c, unexec.c, ymakefile:
	Bugs and fixes for att3b (and usg)
	Use a global static var rather than a local one
	to record the last block allocated by alloca.

	* fileio.c (Fverify_visited_file_modtime):
	If a formerly-nonexistent file has been created since we ``found''
	it, say there is a discrepancy.

Tue Oct 14 19:08:18 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* callint.c (Fprefix_numeric_value):
	Doc typo.

	* malloc.c, regex.c:
	Nuke "#if defined..." for VMS

Sun Oct 12 00:02:50 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xdisp.c (many functions):
	Rearrange the way in which the mode-line stuff is hacked:
	in particular, display_string doesn't have a special-case
	for %-escapes -- this is now all done in display_mode_element.
	This was necessary to make %M work correctly.
	Also, fix a few bugs (buffer-name truncation could cause
	core-dump)

	Dike out global-minor-modes.  This wasn't actually being used by
	anything (due to a bug) and wasn't even being initialised!
	minor-mode-alist does what this thought it was doing.

Sat Oct 11 15:45:35 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* doc.c (FSnarf_documentation):
	In CANNOT_DUMP case wasn't treating PATH_EXEC as a path --
	now uses exec-path instead.	

	* lisp.h:
	Get rid of #if defined... for benefit of vms

Thu Oct  9 20:52:25 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* abbrev.c (Funexpand_abbrev):
	Preserve position of point.

Tue Oct  7 00:08:00 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* s-hpux.h:
	#define HAVE_PTYS

	* alloca.c:
	Make some attempt to work in the USG case where "#define static"
	is done.

	* keyboard.c:
	#undef FIONREAD in HPUX (seems to be unimplemented or broken)
	The only reason this ever seemed to work was because of a bug in
	v17.

	* sysdep.c (child_setup_tty):
	HPUX was defaulting terminal speed to 300 baud.

	* alloca.s:
	New hp9000 C function calling sequence.

	* fileio.c (Fexpand_file_name):
	Fix bug in (expand-file-name ".." "/foo/")

	* callint.c (Fcall_interactively):
	Remove extreme weirdness of storing (int) "" where a Lisp_Object
	was expected (in visargs)
	Slighly more informative error message for bad interactive code
	letter.

	* abbrev.c (Funexpand_abbrev):
	Was deleting length of original text rather than length of
	expanded abbrev.

	* abbrev.c (Fexpand_abbrev):
	Add an Fundo_boundary so that undo works to unexpand
	abbrevs.

Fri Oct  3 16:07:32 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* ymakefile: Make LIBS_STANDARD the last libs loaded.

	* xterm.c: Load sys/types.h explicitly if xterm.h doesn't do it.

	* keyboard.c (interrupt_signal):
	Delete suprious `)' in HAVE_X_WINDOWS case.

Fri Oct  3 14:08:00 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* sysdep.c (sys_suspend -- fake suspend case)
	Missing comment */ terminator

Thu Oct  2 21:43:35 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* search.c:
	There may be `holes' in regexp registers after a match: consider
	matching "z" against "\\(\\(xyzzy\\)\\|\\)\\(z\\)" -- then
	register 2 is unmatched, whilst registers 0, 1 and 3 have matches.
	Fix register-hacking code in Flooking_at, search_buffer,
	Fmatch_data, Fstore_match_data.

	* crt0.c:
	HP200 floating-point (sigh -- needed for load-average)

	* sysdep.c (HPUX perror):
	Should be "perror" not "_perror" -- communication foulup, sorry.

Wed Oct  1 00:00:52 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* marker.c (Fcopy_marker): Was stupidly failing to put
	the new marker on the buffer's chain.  Fix to go thru Fset_marker.
	This really does fix the crashes in GC.

	* sysdep.c (for HPUX): Define utimes and _perror as no-ops.

	* marker.c (Fset_marker): If attempt to set marker
	to point to a dead buffer, set it to point nowhere.

	* buffer.c (Fkill_buffer): Clear out the buffer's markers chain.

	* keyboard.c (interrupt_signal):
	Turn off the double-C-g feature when running under X windows.

Mon Sep 29 03:44:28 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* search.c: search_regs elements are now the correct character
	numbers or string indices.  1 is not added when they are used;
	instead the values are corrected just after regex library returns.
	The loops to do this exit at the first -1 (unused register).

	* alloca.s: Convert HP9000 code to new assembler syntax.
	Rename flag hp9000s200 to hp9000. [mly]

	* crt0.c: Convert HP9000 code to new assembler syntax. [mly]

	* buffer.c (Fdelete_buffer_internal): Unused; deleted.

	* marker.c (unchain_marker):
	Dump core if first marker on buffers marker list
	does not have that buffer as its buffer.
	May help find bug where after GC a buffer's first marker
	was on the free list.

	* keyboard.c (cmd_error): In -batch, die after error message.

	* bytecode.c (Fbytecode):
	Open-code Bvarref with one-byte arg.

	* callproc.c (init_callproc): Use only first element of
	Vexec_path to make Vexec_directory.  [mly]

Sun Sep 28 19:21:37 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* data.c (Fsymbol_value): use assq_no_quit instead of Fassq.
	* fns.c (assq_no_quit): Like Fassq but never quits or gets errors.

	* keyboard.c (quit_throw_to_get_char):
	* eval.c (Fsignal):
	Call quit_error_check.
	* dispnew.c (quit_error_check):
	Dump core if DesiredScreen is not full of zeros.
	This is to catch the bug wherein DoDsp called from get_char
	died because DesiredScreen was full of lines already.

Fri Sep 26 17:01:09 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* regex.c (re_match_2), search.c (various):
	The registers modified by re_{search,match}{,_2}
	now have start and end of -1 if that register was
	not used in the match found.
	Fmatch_data now returns a list of twice the number of registers
	-actually- used (including register 0, for the whole match)

	* process.c (Fwaiting_for_user_input_p):
	New function for use by process-filters and sentinels
	so they can determine if it might be an appropriate time
	to try to make some sort of asynchronous notification.

Fri Sep 26 04:08:54 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keymap.c (syms_of_keymap): Add missing defsubr
	for Fdefine_prefix_command,

	* abbrev.c (Fexpand_abbrev): Save original text of the abbrev
	in Vlast_abbrev_text.
	* abbrev.c (Funexpand_abbrev): Restore the original text.
	Thus expand and unexpand preserves case.
	Also, if there is no abbrev to unexpand, do nothing.
	* abbrev.c (syms_of_abbrev):
	Turn Lisp variables last-abbrev and last-abbrev-text back on.
	* abbrev.c (Flast_abbrev_expansion): Delete this function.

Thu Sep 25 18:30:35 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* window.c (Fwindow_width): return a value one smaller
	for partial-width windows that contain a | border.

	* macros.c: Remove Fname_last_kbd_macro (moved to macros.el).

Thu Sep 25 07:54:12 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* unexec.c:
	Include a.out.h before getpagesize.h, since EXEC_PAGESIZE
	may be defined in a.out.h

	* dispnew.c:
	Only define TIOCOUTQ as TCOUTQ if the latter as defined,
	so that ifdef conditionals on the former work as expected.

	* sysdep.c (sys_suspend):
	Needed to include buffer.h for getting cwd when doing a fake suspend.
	  (for system v and other complete losers)
	Rather than doing that include (which tickled some cretin-compiler
	bugs) look up bf_cur->default_directory by
	Fsymbol_value (Qintern ("..."))

Wed Sep 24 21:28:47 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* editfns.c (Fregion_beginning, Fregion_end):
	Share common code (this doesn't have to be so fast that the
	extra function-call could hurt)

	* editfns.c, window.c, callint.c, buffer.c:
	Don't allow bf_cur->mark to be nil.
	Instead, to indicate that the mark is not set,
	make the marker not point at anything.
	This simplifies life quite a lot.

	Add sanity checking in case user sets mark to point to different
	buffer (he could do this by side-effecting (marker-mark) stupidly)

	Change definition of marker-mark so that it returns a marker
	object which doesn't point anywhere when there is no mark,
	rather than nil.  This is more useful.

	* editfns.c, bytecode.c.
	Move set-mark, mark to lisp code.

	* editfns.c (Fset_mark)
	Not interactive.

Tue Sep 23 14:26:18 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* crt0.c, m-hp9000.h: rename hp9000s200 to hp9000.
	* m-hp9000.h: New name for m-hp200.h.
	* unexec.c (for hpux): define MY_ID from HP9000S200_ID
	if that exists; else use model.h.
	

Sun Sep 21 18:48:48 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* search.c (search_buffer): Fix backwards condition
	in whether the translate table can be ignored.

	* process.c (Fprocess_send_string): Name of function for Lisp
	had a typo.

	* eval.c: When looping getting the function definitions of
	symbols, check for quit.

	* lisp.h: Restore old declaration of `getenv'
	since removing it causes warnings in many places.

	* minibuf.c (scmp): Return correct value.

Sun Sep 21 18:12:45 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* editfns.c (Finsert_char):
	New function.  There are a lot of places in lisp code
	which want to insert multiple copies of a constant char.
	This is a faster way of doing it, and doesn't cons
	(unlike (insert (make-string n c)))

Sun Sep 21 15:33:20 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (make_process): Code to compute # elts in
	vector to make a Lisp_Process had several errors:
	Took size of pointer rather than of struct Lisp_Vector
	and had wrong sign compensating for first element.

	* fileio.c (directory_file_name): If arg is "/", return "/".

Sat Sep 20 21:08:35 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* minibuf.c (Fdisplay_completion_list):
	New Lisp-callable function replaces minibuffer_completion_help_1,
	with a little new feature: elements of the completion list
	may be lists of two strings, and if so the two strings
	are printed in immediate succession.

Fri Sep 19 13:06:39 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* minibuf.c (scmp and callers)
	Don't be fazed by '\0' in strings.

	* lisp.h, search.c, minibuf.c
	Use downcase_table

Thu Sep 18 18:32:57 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* ymakefile, emacs.c, callproc.c, process.c, fns.c
	Install MAINTAIN_ENVIRONMENT conditional to call environ.c.

Tue Sep 16 02:01:17 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keymap.c (where_is_in_buffer): Fix bug in checking for shadowed
	keys: do Flookup_key only on local map, and ignore value if
	it is a number (that means key is locally undefined).

Mon Sep 15 12:33:10 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* buffer.c (Fbury_buffer)
	Make this function interactive (bury current buffer)
	Do error-checking on arg.

Mon Sep 15 00:47:34 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* emacs.c (main): Eliminate VMS -nl switch.
	Instead, `-map FILE' says to map data file FILE;
	no switch means don't map any file.
	Can call mapin_data directly since exact file name is given.

	* emacs.c (undump_emacs): Delete this.

	* emacs.c (main): Make it work to use more than one of the
	special switches (-batch, -t, -map).

Sun Sep 14 17:15:37 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* Renamings for VMS.
	config.h.dist => config.h-dist
	paths.h.dist => paths.h-dist
	[ms]-*.*.h => [ms]-*-*.h
	s-usg5.2.2.h => s-usg5-2-2.h

	* Some new files for VMS.
	compile.com, link.com, precomp.com, ccom.com,
	testemacs.com, build.com are command files.
	temacs.opt is a linker control file.
	VMSBUILD gives info on how to use them.
	README describes what this directory is for.

Sat Sep 13 20:13:11 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* sysdep.c (reset_sys_modes):
	Delete never-used VMS & SIGIO conditional.
	Call reset_sigio just once.  No need to clear FASYNC here
	now that init_sigio makes sure it is clear in old_fcntl_modes.

	* eval.c (top_level_value, top_level_set):
	These are new names for Fglobal_value and Fglobal_set,
	which are no longer callable from Lisp.
	They are also commented out.

Fri Sep 12 00:19:37 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xfns.c (Fx_rebind_key)
	Fix typo.

	* mocklisp.c:
	Delete ml-substr.  Move to mlsupport.el

	* buffer.c
	The real work of setting up mode_line_default is done in
	loaddefs.el.

	* lread.c, data.c, marker.c, window.c
	Flush the last callers of defalias.  Flush defalias.
	(Use fsets in subr.el instead)

Thu Sep 11 10:15:14 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* emacs.c (main)
	Under X, accept "-display" switch as synonym for "-d"

	* eval.c (spedcbind)
	Don't make Lisp_Buffer_Objfwd's buffer-local when just binding.
	(so now (let ((case-fold-search t))) doesn't force buffer-localness)
	However, setting a binding will still make it buffer-local.
	(ie (let ((case-fold-search t)) (setq case-fold-search t))
	 will cause case-fold-search be buffer-local even outside the let)

	* xfns.c
	Preserve studlycaps: "Gnuemacs" => "GNU Emacs"

	* Various
	Flush last users of LISTP => CONSP

	* buffer.h
	Make backed_up a Lisp_Object, since it is one!
	Make abbrev_table a magic-local-variable.

	* alloc.c (mark_buffer)
	Simplify, simplify.

	* buffer.h:
	Reorder elements of struct buffer so that Lisp_Object
	slots are contiguous from buffer.name through to the
	end of the buffer.  All slots before buffer.name are
	not Lisp_Objects (except buffer.markers, which is gc-magic)

	Eliminate useless buffer.number slot.

	* buffer.c (Fbuffer_number):
	delete.	

Wed Sep 10 17:32:47 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (Fsend_{string,region}): rename as Fprocess_send...
	and change names of Lisp function.  Old names now aliases in subr.el.

Wed Sep 10 15:57:01 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* buffer.c
	New struct buffer_local_symbols.
	staticpro buffer_defaults, buffer_local_symbols.

	* lread.c (defvar_per_buffer)
	Hack buffer_local_symbols

	(a) Fcopy_alist so don't return any shared list structure
	(b) Include names and values of Lisp_Buffer_Objfwd locals.

	* alloc.c (FGarbage_collect):
	Don't mark buffer_defaults specially, as it is now in staticvec

	* dired.c (Fdirectory_files):
	Optional third argument match is a regexp specifying
	to only return files whose names contain a match for that regexp.
	[eg ``(directory-files "/u2/emacs/" nil "\\`[^#]")'']

Wed Sep 10 02:11:56 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* alloc.c (Fgarbage_collect): Use open code instead of Fnthcdr
	to avoid possibility of error.

	* lread.c (Fload, load_unwind): The Lisp_Internal_Stream
	now points to a word got with xmalloc and that points to the FILE.
	On Elxsi, the FILE address is not in the part of the address
	space that Lisp_Object pointers can reach.  New way can't lose.

Tue Sep  9 23:21:11 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* crt0.c: Add _start for elxsi.

Sun Sep  7 12:07:46 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* minibuf.c (read_minibuf)
	gc-protect the saved data!
	  I'm don't know why this doesn't just bind help-form
	  (and current-prefix-arg) esp since there is already an
	   unbind_to which would help us do this.
	   Since I don't know why the `bindings' are done this way,
	   I'm leaving the unwind-protect hair, and adding GCPRO hair.

	* minibuf.c (read_minibuf, read_minibuf_unwind)
	preserve the value of current-prefix-arg.

	* minibuf.c:
	Eliminate read_minibuf_string.
	Move defalias for read-input to subr.el

	* callint.c, fns.c, lisp.h

	* dispnew.c (update_screen):
	Take out previous change.

	* xdisp.c (DoDsp): Move call to request_sigio
	after update: so it cannot be bypassed.

	* sysdep.c (init_sigio): set old_fcntl_flags here
	only once; don't change it in request_sigio.
	* sysdep.c ({un,}request_sigio):
	Set interrupts_deferred while SIGIO is unrequested.
	Abort if FASYNC is already set when request_sigio is called.
	* keyboard.c (get_input_pending):
	Always do FIONREAD if interrupts_deferred.

Mon Sep  1 11:03:49 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* xterm.c/xfns.c: Many changes from rlk,
	including using sigblock/sigsetmask to block signals
	instead of turning handler off and on.

	* dispnew.c (update_screen):
	If interrupt input, wait while output gets written
	before returning.  If observed loss of output really is
	a kernel bug, this may make it stop.

Sun Aug 31 04:14:58 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keymap.c (where_is_in_buffer):
	Use Fequal rather than EQ to test for a match

Sat Aug 30 05:19:38 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* data.c (Fsetq_default): new function.

Thu Aug 28 03:58:51 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_element):
	Cons cell whose car is a symbol now means
	(SYMBOL IF_TRUE_DISPLAY IF_FALSE_DISPLAY)
	and is equivalent to IF_TRUE_DISPLAY if SYMBOL's value is non-nil
	or to IF_FALSE_DISPLAY if SYMBOL is unbound or has value nil.
	* buffer.c (syms_of_buffer): update documentation for that.

Mon Aug 25 01:27:31 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fns.c (merge): Swap the arguments to the sort predicate
	so as to use it to compute <= rather than <.
	Sort had been anti-stable; now it is stable.

	* editfns.c (Fuser_uid, Fuser_real_uid):
	New functions that return values of geteuid and getuid system calls.

	* dired.c (Ffile_attributes):  Value has additional element
	t iff file gid would change if Emacs deletes it and recreates it.

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_element):
	If element is a list and its car is a list,
	process all list elements recursively and concatenate them.
	Makes alists work.

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_string): New element type %n
	prints ` Narrow' and ` Def' if appropriate.
	* buffer.c (syms_of_buffer): Fix documentation of mode-line-format.

	* undo.c (Fundo_more):
	Fix bugs in checking len and pos for being in bounds.

	negative means it's a user variable.
	* doc.c (Fdocumentation_property):
	Use abs value of property as the file position.
	* doc.c (FSnarf_documentation):
	For variables, store negative property if string starts with `*'.

	Athena, and fixed up formatting conventions.

Sat Aug 23 17:02:41 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* eval.c (unbind_catch): Restore gcprolist from the catchtag.

Thu Aug 21 22:43:45 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (barf_or_query_if_file_exists):
	New second arg non-0 says query; do not call Finteractive_p.

	* fileio.c (Frename_file, Fcopy_to_file, Fadd_name_to_file,
	Fmake_symbolic_link):
	Interactive spec now says `p' for the third arg.
	If third arg is number, do call barf_or_query_if_file_exists
	but pass nonzero second arg in that case.

	* eval.c (Finteractive_p): Skip the innermost frame
	when examining the stack.  This makes the right thing happen
	if called from Fbyte_code.

	the standard Unix environment.
	* process.c (create_process): likewise.

	* bytecode.c (Fbyte_code): At end, abort if specpdl
	is not back to same level it had on entry.

	* eval.c (unbind_catch):
	New way to unbind for throw.  Pops catches, handlers
	and bindings, in one synchronized pass.  Thus, when an
	unwind-protect is executed, all catches and handlers
	outside of it are still in effect.
	Also restore various static variables from the catchtag
	being unbound.  struct catchtag has two new fields,
	gcpro and pdlcount.

	* eval.c (Fthrow, Fsignal):  Use unbind_catch before longjmp.

	* eval.c (internal_catch): No need to restore anything
	from the catchtag after throw, because unbind_catch does it all.
	Must set up pdlcount and gcpro fields.
	* eval.c (internal_condition_case, Fcondition_case):
	Changed like internal_catch.
	* eval.c (Fcatch): use internal_catch to do the work.

	* eval.c (Fsignal): If no handler applies, try calling
	the Lisp debugger; if that fails, throw to top-level.
	Don't call `debugger'.

	* keyboard.c (debugger): Delete this function.

Wed Aug 20 12:49:38 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* Gap motion can now quit!

	* insdel.c (move_gap): new name for GapTo.  Callers changed.

	* insdel.c (InsCStr):
	* fileio.c (Finsert_file_contents):
	Call move_gap before calling record_insert.
	* insdel.c (del_range):
	Don't adjust point until after all possible errors detected,
	which means after gap is moved.

	* insdel.c (gap_right, gap_left):
	Check every 32000 chars for pending quit.
	Also speed up char-copy inner loop.

	* lisp.h (QUITP): New macro, nonzero if ought to quit now if poss.

Wed Aug 20 00:12:25 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* undo.c (Fundo_more):
	Fix bug that was setting point to `len' field, not `pos' field.
	Share the error-checking code between all three types of
	undo record that actually make changes.

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_element):
	Fix a couple of silly bugs.

	* lread.c: New variable-defining functions
	defvar_int, defvar_lisp, defvar_bool and defvar_per_buffer
	are called by the new DEFVAR... macros.  They ignore the
	doc-string argument.

	* lisp.h: Define macros DEFVAR_LISP, DEFVAR_INT, DEFVAR_BOOL
	and DEFVAR_PER_BUFFER.  They expand into calls to
	defvar_lisp, etc.

	* all .c files:
	All Def...Var renamed to DEFVAR... in syms_of_....

	* doc.c (FSnarf_documentation): Understand new DOC format
	where doc for function foo is named Ffoo and doc for variable foo
	is named Vfoo.  When doc for a variable is found, store the
	file-position in DOC on the variable-documentation property.
	* doc.c (Fdocumentation_property): New Lisp function,
	like `get' except that if the value is a positive integer
	it is taken as a position in the DOC file and a string is read
	from that file.

	* filelock.c: correct spelling "supercession" -> "supersession".

	* undo.c: Rename RecordInsert as record_insert, and
	likewise RecordDelete, RecordChange and RecordChange1.
	* casefiddle.c, editfns.c, fileio.c, insdel.c: change callers.

Tue Aug 19 03:00:43 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_element):
	Change the interpretation of symbols and lists in elements:
	if a symbol's value is a string, output that string literally;
	a list is a concatenation of all elements if the car is a string
	or a conditional of the cdr if the car is a symbol.

	* undo.c (Record...):
	Remember buffer->modtime as the "length" of the Uunmod.
	If point is at the end of a range deleted or changed,
	record that as the "position" of the range and make the length
	negative.

	* undo.c (Fundo_more):
	Undoing Uunmod does not mark as unmodified unless its
	remembered modtime matches the buffer's current modtime.
	Also handle case where length is negative in Uinsert, Uchange.

Mon Aug 18 09:02:36 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_line):
	XSTRING->data, not XSTRING
	Fix another typo.

Sun Aug 17 22:06:41 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.c (syms_of_buffer):
	Change doc for mode-line-format.

	* xdisp.c (display_mode_line, display_mode_element):
	Allow buf->mode_line_format to contain lists and symbols
	allowing computation and concatenation to produce the mode line.
	(Note that evaluation is not allowed; it would be unsafe.)
	display_mode_element is the recursion point for this.

Sun Aug 17 19:40:05 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* emacs.c (main)
	Move init_environ up.

	* window.c (Fwindow_point)
	typo.	

	* environ.c
	New function getenv replaces un*x getenv

Sun Aug 17 19:04:41 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* window.c (Fwindow_point):
	When WINDOW is the selected window and its buffer is selected too,
	return current value of point.  The pointm field of the window
	is not meaningful in such cases.

	* unexec.c (write_segment):
	If hit nonexistent page, must write zeros, not return.

Sun Aug 17 14:28:48 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* callproc.c, process.c (Fcall_process, create_process)
	Use `alloca' versions of environment-hacking functions
	(ie current_environ_size and get_current_environ rather than
	current_environ and free_environ)

	* emacs.c (main):
	Call syms_of_environ, init_environ.

	* config.h., config.h.dist
	Increase PURESIZE again (sigh)	

	* unexec.c (write_segment):
	Kludgey coercions ("(int)") to get this line to compile:
         nwrite = (((int) ptr + 128) & ~127) - (int) ptr;
	Also changed incorrect ~128 to ~127.

	* process.c:
	New function Fprocess_list.

Sun Aug 17 05:56:29 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* crt0.c, alloca.s: Remove hack_sky (special for sun2)
	and the call to it.  No longer needed since floating point
	is no longer used.

	* unexec.c: New compiler flag A_TEXT_OFFSET is defined
	for machines in which the a.out file header counts as the
	first few bytes of the text segment.  The definition of
	A_TEXT_OFFSET would normally be sizeof (HDR).  It has
	other terms added in on some machines (sequent).

Sat Aug 16 18:42:35 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* eval.c (Fmacroexpand)

	Move VMS sys_getenv to environ.c

	* editfns.c:
	Move getenv to environ.c

	* xdisp.c (display_text_line):
	* indent.c (current_column, ToCol, position_indentation):
	* indent.c (Fmove_to_column, compute_motion):
	Bring tab_width in range if it is very large.

Fri Aug 15 03:05:00 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region):
	Do the fsync before the fstat; that may prevent what appear
	to be spurious "file has changed on disk" warnings.
	Update bf_cur->modtime before signaling "IO error writing"
	to avoid more such warnings.

	* Make ctl-arrow, case-fold-search, etc. behave exactly
	as if they had been made local with make-variable-buffer-local.
	The default values live in struct buffer buffer_defaults.
	They also live in buffers that do not have local values.
	Each buffer has a local_var_flags slot with a bit for each
	variable, saying which variables are local in that buffer.

	* buffer.h: New buffer slot local_var_flags.
	* buffer.c: New structures buffer_defaults and buffer_local_flags.
	(init_buffers_once): store default values for local slots
	into buffer_defaults.
	(reset_buffer_variables): Copy default values from buffer_defaults
	into the buffer being reset.
	(syms_of_buffer): Variables default-ctl-arrow, etc., now
	forward to slots in buffer_defaults.

	* data.c (Fset, Fset_default, Fdefault_value,
	Fkill_local_variable):
	Know that a Lisp_Buffer_Objfwd has default value
	if the buffer_local_flags slot is nonzero,
	and a buffer uses that default unless its local_var_flags
	contains the bit of the buffer_local_flags for the slot.

	* alloc.c (Fgarbage_collect): Call mark_buffer on buffer_defaults.

Thu Aug 14 18:40:13 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* unexec.c (copy_text_and_data):
	Write text and data separately if COFF (just as if not COFF).
	(make-hdr): if COFF and NO_REMAP, don't alter some f_ohdr fields.

Thu Aug 14 16:35:21 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* editfns.c (getenv)
	Make getenv useful interactively.
	Move defaliases to fsets in subr.el

Thu Aug 14 04:45:39 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* unexec.c: unexec_data_start records the ultimate
	corrected data_start from make_hdr; copy_text_and_data
	starts writing data segment from that address.

Wed Aug 13 04:45:18 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* buffer.c (Fkill_buffer): Combine Fdelete_buffer_internal
	into this function.  Simplify.  Just return immediately
	if attempted to kill the minibuffer.

	* lisp.h: Define XSETPNTR and make XSETCONS (etc) use it.
	By default XSETPNTR is the same as XSETUINT.

	* lread.c (oblookup, map_obarray):
	Use XUINT, not XSYMBOL, to check for zero to detect end of bucket.
	On machines where all pointers have high bits set,
	XSYMBOL would never return zero.

	* alloc.c: change vars most_negative_fixnum and dont_copy_flag
	to constant macros ARRAY_MARK_FLAG and DONT_COPY_FLAG,
	defined normally based on INTBITS but overridable by m-*.h.

	* process.c (handle_process_output):
	Write in buffer even if buffer is read-only.

	* fileio.c (barf_or_query_if_file_exists):
	Rearrange: don't use comma around calls to NULL,
	so can compile using union type.

Tue Aug 12 10:45:44 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* buffer.c (SetBfp, syms_of_buffer)
	Dike out debug-check-symbol code.  I believe that this bug has
	evaporated.

	* fileio.c (barf_or_query_if_file_exists)
	! => !NULL.  Also use local variable for Lisp_object for bd
	compilers.

Mon Aug 11 12:22:05 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* buffer.c (Fbarf_if_buffer_read_only)
	Include buffer in call to Fsignal.

	* print.c (Fwrite_char)
	Really default stream to standard-output.

Sun Aug 10 00:18:48 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* eval.c (and abbrev.c, buffer.c, callint.c, cmds.c, keyboard.c, lread.c, lisp.h)
	Allow Fapply to take an &rest arg, the last of which is spread.
	(So (apply '+ 1 '(2 3)) => 6)
	Make Ffuncall do the work for Fapply, rather than duplicating all
	that code.  Define apply1 for c code which needs it.  Define call0
	for c code which thought it needed Fapply.

Fri Aug  8 11:56:10 1986  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at prep)

	* ymakefile
	Don't assemble alloca.s if HAVE_ALLOCA.
	Even though the whole of this file is contained in a
	`#ifndef HAVE_ALLOCA ... #endif' a disgusting bug
	in cc (at least here, vax 4.2bsd) meant that this
	file was being assembled even though cc was passed
	the -E flag!  Gag me with a unix-pinhead.

	* m-vax.h
	Define HAVE_ALLOCA if BSD

	* unexec.c (write_segment)
	Rename variable `fd' to `new' for macro PERROR.

Wed Jul 30 21:23:27 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region): add call to fsync before close.

	* xdisp.c (redisplay_window): Don't look at ->start
	in windows that have subwindows, since it is nil there.

	* window.c (save_window_restore):
	Avoid doing Fset_buffer on a dead buffer.
	Use the selected window's new current buffer in that case.

Mon Jul 28 21:01:35 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (Finsert_file_contents):
	Don't mark buffer modified if inserted a null file.

	* fileio.c (Fcopy_file, e_write): Use 16k buffer size.

Thu Jul 17 05:05:50 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* unexec.c (copy_sym): Put in missing #endif.

	* alloc.c (Fpurecopy, mark_object): Flush VIRT_ADDR_VARIES
	conditional; always use range from pure to pure + PURESIZE.
	Use type PNTR_COMPARISON_TYPE as the type to compare in.
	This is normally unsigned int but m- file may override this.

	* lisp.h (CHECK_IMPURE): Use PNTR_COMPARISON_TYPE, and always
	use the range from pure to pure + PURESIZE unless
	PNTR_COMPARISON_TYPE is defaulted.

	* eval.c (unbind_to): New temporary var `tmp'
	to avoid a Gould compiler bug.

	* term.c (calculate_ins_del_char_costs):
	* window.c (change_window_height):
	Changed floating point arithmetic to fixed point.

	* sysdep.c: Replace ad-hoc conditionals with new flags
	HAVE_VFORK, HAVE_DUP2 and HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY.
	Change s-hpux.h and m-stride.h.

	* sysdep.c (init_sys_modes for VMS): Set TT2$M_XON.

	* process.c (create_process): On USG systems that have TIOCNOTTY,
	do the setpgrp here before reopening the pty rather than
	waiting for child_setup.

	* window.c (make_window): size given to make_vector
	was one too small.

Thu Jul 10 12:19:07 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* search.c (Freplace_match): delete unused some_multiletter_word init.
	* alloc.c (gc_sweep): delete unused next initializers.
	* fns.c (concat): after error on non-int elt for string,
	   do store the new value from the error handler.
	* lread.c (read1): comment out unused end =.
	* lread.c (read_list): delete unused tail =.
	* data.c (Fmake_variable_buffer_local):
	  if value type is Lisp_Some_Buffer_Local_Value,
	  change it to Lisp_Buffer_Local_Value permanently.
	* undo.c (record_block): delete unused cp =.
	  Don't bother reallocing if n = 0 after first batch.
	* fileio.c (Fverify_visited_file_modtime):
	  If CHECK_BUFFER changes buf, use the changed value.

Mon Jul  7 13:59:16 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	change applied to M-- arg ratherthan C-u by mistake.

Thu Jun 19 12:32:53 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* ymakefile (CPP): Now defined by default as `cc -E'.
	* Makefile: likewise.

	* More 3b changes:
	* ymakefile: Allow config to specify LIBS_TERMCAP even if
	TERMINFO.
	* sysdep.c: Delete the sign-extension functions; just define
	a variable sign_extend_temp.
	* m-3b.h renamed to m-3b20.h.  Now defines ATT3B20 as well as
	ATT3B.  New definitions for XINT and SIGN_EXTEND_CHAR.

	* sysdep.c (readdirver): New VMS-only function:
	like readdir but return each version as separate filename.

	* dired.c (file_name_completions): New arg ver_flag.
	All callers changed.
	* dired.c (Ffile_name_all_versions): New function, VMS only.

	* unexec.c (copy_sym): Remove spurious #else on
	sun3 conditional.  The old #else code is now unconditional.

	* window.c (Fdisplay_window): Split largest window only if
	full screen width.  The conditional was backwards.

Tue Jun 17 05:49:16 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (Fsend_region): Previous change forgot to assign
	anything to start1.

Fri Jun 13 02:09:29 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* emacs.c (Fdump_emacs): Use start_of_text, not &_start,
	as entry address for unexec.

	* alloc.c: Use XPNTR, not XUINT, when checking for pureness.

	* data.c: When indirecting through Lisp_Buffer_Objfwd,
	use XUINT to get the offset, not XOBJFWD.

	* lisp.h: New macro XPNTR is used as subroutine by all of
	XCONS, XSTRING, etc.  Define it like XUINT normally.
	If DATA_SEG_BITS is defined, XPNTR or's that into the result.
	Use XPNTR in CHECK_IMPURE.

	* sysdep.c (end_of_{text,data}): Do compile these.
	rt-pc unexec needs them.
	* sysdep.c (start_of_bss): New function.

	* unexec.c (copy_text_and_data, write_segment):
	Write text and data segments separately.
	Use new subroutine write_segment to do each one.

	* process.c (Fprocess_exit_status):
	New name for Fprocess_reason.

Wed Jun 11 17:01:32 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* abbrev.c (Fexpand_abbrev):
	Delete the - inserted by abbrev-prefix-mark, if any.

	* filelock.c (lock_file):
	Check for modifying a buffer whose file has changed
	and call ask-user-about-supercession-threat, which can
	ask for confirmation and get an error.

Tue Jun 10 00:45:11 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* crt0.c: Merge changes for Nu.

	* unexec.c (make_hdr): Fix handling of blockcopy_start;
	for the sake of Nu machine.

	* fileio.c (Fcopy_file): optional 4th arg non-nil
	means preserve the last-modified time.

	* Make C-M-v in minibuffer scroll the minibuffer's help window if any.
	* window.c (save_window_{save,restore}):
	Save and restore minibuf_scroll_window.
	* window.c (Fscroll_other_window):
	If minibuffer is selected, scroll minibuf_scroll_window.
	* minibuf.c (read_minibuf): set minibuf_scroll_window to nil.

	* window.c (Frecenter): With just C-u as arg,
	recenter point but don't erase the screen.

Mon Jun  9 09:27:09 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c (Fsend_region):
	* fileio.c (Fwrite_region):
	* editfns.c (Fchar_after, save_restriction_restore):
	Avoid using XINT in args to other macros.

	* sysdep.c: New function char_sign_xtnd for ATT3B.

	* lisp.h: Don't redefine XINT if it's already defined.
	So m-3b.h can override it.

	* ymakefile: If NO_REMAP, use the standard crt0.o
	but precede it with pre_crt0.o whose job is to define data_start.

	* buffer.h. buffer.c: New per-buffer variable 
	selective-display-ellipses.

	* xdisp.c (display_text_line), indent.c (compute_motion):
	Let bf_cur->selective_display_ellipses control display of ...
	before invisible lines.

	* lread.c (openp, Fload): openp now takes a sequence
	of suffixes with colons between.  It loops over
	suffixes faster than over directories.
	load takes new fourth arg NOSUFFIXES.

Sun Jun  8 16:01:48 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* paths.h: Remove . from load-path.

	* lread.c: Make "load" no longer interactive.

	* keyboard.c: Introduce BUFFER_SIZE_FACTOR to make
	some keyboard buffers 16 times as big when X windows exist.

Sat Jun  7 17:08:19 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* eval.c (call_debugger): Don't do a debug-on-call
	for calling the debugger.

	* keyboard.c (gobble_input): Must really use FIONREAD.

	* keyboard.c (command_loop{,_1,_2}, top_level_{1,2}):
	Now Frecursive_edit calls command_loop, which does the catches
	and calls command_loop_2, which does the error handling,
	which calls command_loop to do the real work.
	Also, top_level_1 does a condition-case around top_level_2,
	which does the work.

	Previously, the error handling was outside the catch for
	top-level.  Then if handling an error ran an unwind protect form,
	the catch was not in effect; so ^G, or the debugger Q command,
	would not work inside of them.

Fri Jun  6 00:28:18 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* keymap.c (get_keymap{,_1}):
	Create get_keymap_1 that takes arg saying whether to get error.
	get_keymap calls that, saying do get an error.

	* keyboard.c (get_char):
	If rereading a char, do put it in the echo buffer
	if the echo buffer is empty.  Fixes problem that
	C-s C-h would never echo the C-h.

	* window.h: New window slot start_at_line_beg,
	holds t if window's start was the beginning of a line.
	* window.c: update this wherever ->start is updated.
	(But not always correctly).
	* xdisp.c (redisplay_window): update start_at_line_beg,
	and also find a new start if the old start used to be
	a line beginning but no longer is (which implies text
	changes just before it).

	* keyboard.c (get_input_pending):
	Don't bother with FIONREAD if interrupt_input;
	just use kbd_count.

	* fns.c: Assume KERNEL_FILE, LDAV_SYMBOL and NLIST_STRUCT
	are fully set up by the s- and m- files.

	* emacs.c (main): Don't call `signal' if in batch mode
	and not initialized and dumping is possible.
	* keyboard.c (init_keyboard): likewise for SIGIO.

	* unexec.c (make_hdr): Copy entire header of old file
	as base for header of new file.  Eliminates most
	machine-specific conditionals.

	* terminfo.c: make tparam work by calling tparm.

	* term.c, cm.h: Eliminate `Tab' macro.

	* s-usg5.2.h, s-usg5.2.2.h: set the TERMINFO flag.

	* fileio.c (Ffile_newer_than_file_p): New Lisp primitive.

	* fileio.c (Ffile_exists_p):  this is now distinct from
	Ffile_readable_p; it checks only for existence, not for
	readability.

	* editfns.c (Fgoto_char): Use new interactive code N.

	* callint.c (Fcall_interactively): New code N
	means use prefix argif have one, else read number from minibuffer.

	* buffer.c (record_buffer):
	Don't use Frassq, Fmemq or Fdelq since their loops
	allow quitting.  Write a spacial loop by hand.

Thu Jun  5 00:13:27 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* process.c: Add MASSCOMP conditionals for pty and tty names.
	New way to check pty accessibility with `access'.

	* unexec.c (make_hdr): MASSCOMP has its own special field.

	* sysdep.c: Use HAVE_TERMIO conditionals instead of USG
	conditionals in many places.  Use INTERRUPTABLE_OPEN
	and INTERRUPTABLE_IO conditionals to decide whether to
	include the functions sys_read, sys_write, sys_open.
	child_setup_tty must do FIOASYNC on masscomp.

	* fns.c (concat): Add MASSCOMP_REGISTER_BUG conditional.

	* editfns.c (init_editfns): Always check LOGNAME if no USER var.

	* dispnew.c: Now depends on HAVE_TERMIO.

	* crt0.c: BOGUS flag renamed CRT0_DUMMIES.  Also now
	this is never assumes; each m- file must set it to use that code.

	* crt0.c: Two new flags: GLOBAL_START_DOT and
	GLOBAL_START_NO_DOT, control .globl start, etc.
	m- files must define these as needed.
	To have no effect, must define one or the other whenever
	CRT0_DUMMIES is set except for masscomp.
	GLOBAL_START_NO_DOT for tower32, GLOBAL_START_DOT for all others.

	* term.c, termchar.h: Define new flag var no_redraw_on_reenter;
	nonzero means no need to set screen_garbaged on resuming
	after a suspension.
	* sysdep.c (init_sys_modes): don't set screen_garbaged
	after resumption if that flag is set.
	* dispnew.c (syms_of_dispnew): make Lisp var no-redraw-on-reenter,

	* process.c (Fprocess_reason): New function.

	* dispnew.c (change_screen_size): New arg PRETEND.
	If it's zero, set ScreenRows or ScreenCols.
	Fset_screen_{width,height} take new arg as well
	to control value of PRETEND.

	* sysdep.c (child_setup_tty for USG):
	Turn ICANON on, and set VKILL and VERASE to 0377.
	Don't frob VMIN and VTIME (said to be unnecessary here).

	* keyboard.c (command_loop, Frecursive_edit):
	Call top_level_1 only from command_loop.
	Do it before command_loop_1.  Put catch for top-level around it.

	* xdisp.c (try_window_1): use scroll_cost to decide
	whether scrolling, as determined from ins/del records,
	is better than simple reprinting.

	* scroll.c (scroll_cost): New function computes what cost
	would be to do scroll_screen_lines.

	* xdisp.c (display_text_string):
	Display minibuf_prompt only if vpos is the top of the minibuffer.
	Attempts to fix the bug where the prompt appears on all the
	lines of an empty minibuffer.

Wed Jun  4 20:35:49 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* fileio.c (Fdefine_logical_name):
	For VMS: create a logical name translation.

	* emacs.c (main):
	(HAVE_X_WINDOWS) New variable alternate_display,
	set with a -d switch.

	* keyboard.c, sysdep.c:
	Create new system-independent function sys_suspend.
	All places that want to suspend now use sys_suspend.
	Delete fake_suspend and make its definition one of the
	cases for sys_suspend; but require the caller to change
	the terminal modes, on all system versions.

	* Merged in VMS conditionals in numerous files.

Sun Jun  1 04:33:34 1986  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at prep)

	* emacs.c (main, Fdump_emacs):
	Use new arg to malloc_init to say what function to call for
	warnings.

	* unexec.c, malloc.c, getpagesize.h:
	The code to define getpagesize () is now in getpagesize.h.

	* process.c (reate_process), callproc.c (child_setup):
	Move call to child_setup_tty from child_setup to create_process,
	so it's not done for synchronous subprocesses.
	* sysdep.c (child_setup_tty): omit it if not subprocesses.

	* alloc.c (mark_object), lread.c (DefLispVar):
	Protect the C variable with staticpro.
	Therefore no more need to mark thru a Lisp_Objfwd.
