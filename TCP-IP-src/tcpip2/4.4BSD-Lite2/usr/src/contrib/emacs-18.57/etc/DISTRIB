	   GNU Emacs availability information, January 1991
Copyright (C) 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute
   verbatim copies of this document provided that the
   copyright notice and this permission notice are preserved.

GNU Emacs is legally owned by the Free Software Foundation, but we
regard the foundation actually as its custodian on behalf of the
public, since all software ought to be the common property of mankind.

The foundation permits everyone to have and run copies of GNU Emacs,
at no charge, and to redistribute copies under certain conditions
which are designed to make sure that that all modified versions of GNU
Emacs remain as free as the versions we distribute.  These conditions
are stated in the document "GNU Emacs General Public License", a copy
of which is required to be distributed with every copy of GNU Emacs.
It is usually in a file named COPYING in the same directory as this
file.

If you do not know anyone to get a copy of GNU Emacs from, you can
order a tape from the Free Software Foundation.  We distribute Emacs
version 18 on 1600bpi industry standard mag tape in tar format.  We
will also ship it on 1/4" Sun cartridge tapes in tar format and on
1600bpi magtape in VMS interchange (aka backup) format.  We also
distribute nicely typeset copies of the Emacs manual and the Emacs
reference card.  See the order form at the end of this file.

If you have Internet access, you can copy the latest Emacs
distribution from host prep.ai.mit.edu.  There are several ways to do
this; see the file `FTP' in the same directory as this file for more
information.  Even better, get the latest version of the file from
`/pub/gnu/etc/FTP' on prep.ai.mit.edu for the most current
arrangements.  It may also be possible to copy Emacs via uucp; the
file `FTP' contains information on that too.

Emacs has been run on both Berkeley Unix and System V Unix, on a
variety of types of cpu.  It also works on VMS and on Apollo
computers, though with some deficiencies that reflect problems in
these operating systems.  See the file MACHINES in this directory for
a full list of machines that GNU Emacs has been tested on, with
machine-specific installation notes and warnings.

Note that there is significant variation between Unix systems
supposedly running the same version of Unix; it is possible that what
works in GNU Emacs for me does not work on your system due to such an
incompatibility.  Since I must avoid reading Unix source code, I
cannot even guess what such problems may exist.

GNU Emacs is distributed with no warranty (see the General Public
License for full details, in the file COPYING in this directory), and
neither I nor the Free Software Foundation promises any kind of
support or assistance to users.  The foundation keeps a list of people
who are willing to offer support and assistance for hire.  It is
usually in a file named SERVICE in the same directory as this file.
You get the latest version of the file from `/pub/gnu/etc/SERVICE' on
prep.ai.mit.edu.

However, we plan to continue to improve GNU Emacs and keep it
reliable, so please send me any complaints and suggestions you have.
I will probably fix anything that I consider a malfunction.  I may
make improvements that are suggested, but I may choose not to.
Improving Emacs is not my highest priority now.

If you are on the Internet, report bugs to
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu; on UUCP, use the address
...!uunet!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs.  Otherwise, phone the
foundation at the number listed below, or write to the address listed
below.  General questions about the GNU Project can be asked of
gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

If you are a computer manufacturer, I encourage you to ship a copy of
GNU Emacs with every computer you deliver.  The same copying
permission terms apply to computer manufacturers as to everyone else.
You should consider making a donation to help support the GNU project;
if you estimate what it would cost to distribute some commercial
product and divide it by five, that is a good amount.

If you like GNU Emacs, please express your satisfaction with a
donation: send me or the Foundation what you feel Emacs has been worth
to you.  If you are glad that I developed GNU Emacs and distribute it
as freeware, rather than following the obstructive and antisocial
practices typical of software developers, reward me.  If you would
like the Foundation to develop more free software, contribute.

Your donations will help to support the development of more useful
software to be distributed on the same basis as GNU Emacs.  Eventually
we will have a complete imitation of the Unix operating system, called
GNU (Gnu's Not Unix), which will run Unix user programs.  For more
information on GNU, see the file GNU in this directory.

Our Price Increase

Through 1990, our price for tape distribution of an ordinary magnetic
tape was $150.  That price was unchanged since the FSF was founded, in
1985.  Inflation since that time has made that price equivalent to
nearly $200 in today's dollars.  We avoided raising the price for so
long because any price change results in confusion, but at the
beginning of 1991, we decided to get it done once and for all.

A Sun cartridge now costs only $10 more than a reel-to-reel tape
because our quantity purchases have reduced the extra cost to us of
these cartridges.

The VMS tapes cost $195 just to be different.  Sometimes people order
tapes and don't say whether they want Unix or VMS.  Now we will be
able to tell by the price.

We've raised the prices on several manuals because we had very little
margin on them.  Other manuals that weren't squeezing us have
unchanged prices.  This increase has allowed us to offer the sort of
quantity discount for the Emacs manual that bookstores expect, which
may increase the availability of the manual.

Barring a return to severe inflation, our prices should now be stable
for years to come.

The old prices, in effect through January 1991, were:
$150 for a reel-to-reel magnetic tape (regardless of contents), $175
for a Sun cartridge, $15 for an Emacs user's manual, $60 for six Emacs
user's manuals.
