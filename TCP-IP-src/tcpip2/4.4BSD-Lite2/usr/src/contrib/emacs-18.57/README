This directory holds the latest distribution version of GNU Emacs.
 The subdirectory `src' holds the C code,
 `lisp' holds the Lisp code for the editing commands,
 `etc' holds various associated documentation files
    and programs that Emacs runs,
 `info' holds the Info documentation tree.
 `man' holds the source of the Emacs manual.
 `cpp' holds a C preprocessor for use instead of the installed one
   when the installed one fails to distinguish more than 8 characters
   in a symbol name.
 `shortnames' holds programs and data files for creating files of #define's
   used to convert long symbol names to distinct short ones
   for C compiles that cannot distinguish more than 8 characters.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to bring up
 GNU Emacs on Unix, once you have loaded the entire subtree of this
 directory.

The files `build-install' and `Makefile' help automate the process of
 building and installing emacs.  The former is a shell script.  See
 INSTALL for more info.

The file PROBLEMS contains information on many common
 problems that occur in building, installing and running Emacs.

The `etc' subdirectory contains several other files,
 named in capital letters, which you should look at
 when installing GNU Emacs.

The file 'emacs.com' in this directory is for VMS.  It defines
 logical names and commands such as `emacs', so you must edit
 it to specify the file and directory names used on your machine.
 This file must be executed in each session to enable you to run
 the installed Emacs.  It should be executed by your `login.com' file,
 or else perhaps it can be executed once at system boot time.

The file `kepteditor.com' in this directory is also for VMS.
 When a user says to run Emacs, it really runs this command file.

See the files VMSINSTALL and VMSNOTES for more information on VMS use.
