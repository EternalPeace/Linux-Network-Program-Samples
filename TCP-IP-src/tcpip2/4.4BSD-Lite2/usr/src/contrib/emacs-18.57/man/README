This directory contains the Tex sources of the Emacs manual,
plus the macro package (texinfo.tex) necessary for processing it.

1) Run tex on emacs.tex, producing emacs.cp, emacs.fn, emacs.ky,
and emacs.vr (unsorted index files), plus emacs.aux (cross ref file).

2) Compile texindex.c, and run it:
   `texindex emacs.??'
This produces sorted index files emacs.cps, emacs.fns, etc.
that are used as input in step 3.

3) Run tex on emacs.tex again.

4) Now you have a dvi file that you can print.

The latest versions of all the intermediate files are supplied,
so if you want to print the manual with no change, you can start with
step 3.
