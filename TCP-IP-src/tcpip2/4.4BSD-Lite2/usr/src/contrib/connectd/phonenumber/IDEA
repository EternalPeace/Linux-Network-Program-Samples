Don't store numbers and names in tip/uucp/etc files. Obtain them
from "universal" source, ultimately directory info service.

Since numbers may be shared accross geographic regions, store them
as an absolute address, with a simple file and address translation
program used to turn a abs number into a local number.

All numbers held as international numbering plan. Program is given
number + local specifics

To allow for invisable numbers not relavant to known numbering schemes,
untagged numbers are passed thru untranslated. Also, numbers/names 
may have addnl digit strings appended for extension dial-thru.
