#	@(#)README.68040	8.1 (Berkeley) 6/10/93

In order to do floating point on the 68040 you need to incorporate the
HP-UX 7.05 version of Motorola's FP emulation library as hpux_float.o
in this directory.

To build a new kernel using this library, set the option HPFPLIB in the
config file.  You can build a kernel without the FP library by configuring
a kernel without the HPFPLIB option, but be warned that many binaries will
not run.

We are required by Hewlett-Packard and Motorola to state the following
items.

1. No source code is being licensed.

2. The object code can only be used for operation on Motorola M68040
   based systems, and NOT ported to other architectures.

3. Recipients of the code will not reverse compile or disassemble the
   code, except to the extent that such restrictions may be prohibited
   by law.

4. The Motorola Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Company copyright notices will
   be reproduced in the relevant bootup code.

5. The code is provided ``AS IS'' without warranty or obligation of any
   kind.  THERE SHALL BE NO LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
   DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO USE OR POSSESSION OF THE CODE.  THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.

6. Recipients of the code will adhere to the U.S. Export Administration
   Laws and Regulations and will not export or re-export the code or any
   technical data related to the code to any proscribed country listed in
   the U.S. Export Administration Regulations unless properly authorized
   as may be required by the U.S. Government.
