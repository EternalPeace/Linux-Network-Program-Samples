If you plan on using union mounts, then you should consider replacing
three files in "libc/gen" in the C library with the files in "libc"  
in this directory.  The replacement version of opendir() automatically
removes duplicate names when a union stack is encountered. The other
two files do special handling of whiteouts. You will then need to 
rebuild the C library and all commands.
