/*
 * Pmap structure.
 *
 * The pmap structure really comes in two variants, one---a single
 * instance---for kernel virtual memory and the other---up to nproc
 * instances---for user virtual memory.  Unfortunately, we have to mash
 * both into the same structure.  Fortunately, they are almost the same.
 *
 * The kernel begins at 0xf8000000 and runs to 0xffffffff (although
 * some of this is not actually used).  Kernel space, including DVMA
 * space (for now?), is mapped identically into all user contexts.
 * There is no point in duplicating this mapping in each user process
 * so they do not appear in the user structures.
 *
 * User space begins at 0x00000000 and runs through 0x1fffffff,
 * then has a `hole', then resumes at 0xe0000000 and runs until it
 * hits the kernel space at 0xf8000000.  This can be mapped
 * contiguously by ignorning the top two bits and pretending the
 * space goes from 0 to 37ffffff.  Typically the lower range is
 * used for text+data and the upper for stack, but the code here
 * makes no such distinction.
 *
 * Since each virtual segment covers 256 kbytes, the user space
 * requires 3584 segments, while the kernel (including DVMA) requires
 * only 512 segments.
 *
 * The segment map entry for virtual segment vseg is offset in
 * pmap->pm_rsegmap by 0 if pmap is not the kernel pmap, or by
 * NUSEG if it is.  We keep a pointer called pmap->pm_segmap
 * pre-offset by this value.  pmap->pm_segmap thus contains the
 * values to be loaded into the user portion of the hardware segment
 * map so as to reach the proper PMEGs within the MMU.  The kernel
 * mappings are `set early' and are always valid in every context
 * (every change is always propagated immediately).
 *
 * The PMEGs within the MMU are loaded `on demand'; when a PMEG is
 * taken away from context `c', the pmap for context c has its
 * corresponding pm_segmap[vseg] entry marked invalid (the MMU segment
 * map entry is also made invalid at the same time).  Thus
 * pm_segmap[vseg] is the `invalid pmeg' number (127 or 511) whenever
 * the corresponding PTEs are not actually in the MMU.  On the other
 * hand, pm_pte[vseg] is NULL only if no pages in that virtual segment
 * are in core; otherwise it points to a copy of the 32 or 64 PTEs that
 * must be loaded in the MMU in order to reach those pages.
 * pm_npte[vseg] counts the number of valid pages in each vseg.
 *
 * XXX performance: faster to count valid bits?
 *
 * The kernel pmap cannot malloc() PTEs since malloc() will sometimes
 * allocate a new virtual segment.  Since kernel mappings are never
 * `stolen' out of the the MMU, we just keep all its PTEs there, and
 * have no software copies.  Its mmu entries are nonetheless kept on lists
 * so that the code that fiddles with mmu lists has something to fiddle.
