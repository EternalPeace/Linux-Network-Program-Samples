The HP-UX compatibility code still needs to be converted to the new
syscall argument access/description method.  Since the new method is binary
compatible with the old method, it is possible to "sleaze" a solution by
having makesyscalls.sh just use (nargs * 4) as the syscall argsize and not
changing the emulation code.  While this works, it's ugly and should be
cleaned up eventually.
