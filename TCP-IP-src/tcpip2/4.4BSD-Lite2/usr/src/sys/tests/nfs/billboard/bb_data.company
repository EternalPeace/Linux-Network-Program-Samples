# This is an example company data file.  This is the file which is needed
# upon startup of the billboard program.
# There are several designators which mean which type of data follows in
# the line.  The obvious one is the comment designator and the others follow
# in comments of course.
# %P -- The IP address designator.  A list of IP address follow on the line.
# %C -- The company name follows.
# %I -- The implementation name follows.
# %D -- The identifier name follows.
# %B -- The booth number follows.
# %F -- The flags follow: 1 - client only implementation,
#			  2 - server only implementation,
#			  3 - client and server implementations
# %E -- The end of this company data record.
# The semantics are the following:  
#   Comment designators must start in column 0.
#   Data field designators must be in column 1.
#   Any character may preceed a data field designator. ( % is a pretty one )
#   Any character may follow the data field designator, but the data
#   starts in column 3.
