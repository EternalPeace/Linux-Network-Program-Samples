This Sony MIPS R3000 based workstation support is done as an activity of
WIDE research project.  Sony Corporation contributed most device drivers
and gave us great technical supports.  Kazumasa Utashiro worked mainly
4.4BSD implementation but that work was based on 4.3BSD-Reno port helped by
other project members, especially Tadamichi Matsuyama and Hidetoshi Unno.

This version is just a snapshot of developing system and has many
unimplemented features and bugs.  Please contact utashiro@sra.co.jp if you
have any comments about this code.  Bugfix will be greatly appreciated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been using NWS-3200 laptop machine and NWS-3400 for development.
3200's LCD display and NWB-253 display board are supported now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently GCC is used as a compiler which uses as and ld come with NEWS-OS.
They should soon be replaced by the latest GAS because it supports BSD
a.out format for MIPS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known bugs:
	- Display driver is slow.
	- Serial line driver is slow.
	- Console doesn't accept ^S.
	- Some problem probably in VM.
