/*
 * Get a ticket for the password-changing server ("changepw.KRB_MASTER").
 *
 * Given the name, instance, realm, and current password of the
 * principal for which the user wants a password-changing-ticket,
 * return either:
 *
 *	GT_PW_BADPW if current password was wrong,
 *	GT_PW_NULL  if principal had a NULL password,
 *	or the result of the krb_get_pw_in_tkt() call.
 *
 * First, try to get a ticket for "user.instance@realm" to use the
 * "changepw.KRB_MASTER" server (KRB_MASTER is defined in "krb.h").
 * The requested lifetime for the ticket is "1", and the current
 * password is the "cpw" argument given.
 *
 * If the password was bad, give up.
 *
 * If the principal had a NULL password in the Kerberos database
 * (indicating that the principal is known to Kerberos, but hasn't
 * got a password yet), try instead to get a ticket for the principal
 * "default.changepw@realm" to use the "changepw.KRB_MASTER" server.
 * Use the password "changepwkrb" instead of "cpw".  Return GT_PW_NULL
 * if all goes well, otherwise the error.
 *
 * If this routine succeeds, a ticket and session key for either the
 * principal "user.instance@realm" or "default.changepw@realm" to use
 * the password-changing server will be in the user's ticket file.
