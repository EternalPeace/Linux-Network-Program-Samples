.Sh NAME
.Nm mpcc
.Nd multi protocol communications controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device mp0 at vba? csr 0xffff5000 mpintr mpdlintr"
.br
	thru
.Cd "device mp15 at vba? csr 0xffff5f00 mpintr mpdlintr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn MPCC
has two different connecter panel styles.
The 16 port
.Tn MPCC
will support any combination of
.Tn SYNC
or
.Tn ASYNC
ports.
The 32 port
.Tn MPCC
will only support
.Tn ASYNC
ports.
Each async line attached to the
.Tn MPCC
communications controller
behaves as described in
.Xr tty 7
and may be set to run at any of 16 speeds; see
.Xr tty
for the encoding.
.Pp
Each
.Tn MPCC
controller uses two consecutive entries in the
.Tn SCB
for
download/handshake, and command/response interrupts.  These entries
start at 0xa0 for the 1st controllers download/handshake interrupts
and 0xa1 for the 1st controllers command/response.
.Pp
The
.Tn MPCC
controller requires a firmware download to be completed
before it can function.  See
.Xr dlmpcc 8
and
.Xr mpcctab 4
for specific information on how to configure and download the
firmware into the
.Tn MPCC
controller.
.Pp
A maximum of 16
.Tn MPCC
communication controllers can be supported.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mpcc
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.3 tahoe .
.Sh BUGS
As of the
.Bx 4.3 tahoe
release, only 16 port
.Nm mpcc Ns 's
work, and then
only in async mode.  Attempting to reload firmware on an
.Nm mpcc
with
active ports may crash the system.  This should be fixed within
a short period of time; contact the
.Tn CSRG
at University of California,
Berkeley, for upgrade information.
