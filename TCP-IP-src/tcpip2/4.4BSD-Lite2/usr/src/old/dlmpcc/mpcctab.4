.Nm mpcctab
.Nd
.Tn MPCC
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn ASCII
file
.Nm mpcctab
is used to configure
.Tn CCI Ns 's
Multi-Protocol 
Communication Controller
.Pq Tn MPCC . 
The controller provides high-speed
synchronous communications for the
.Tn POWER
family
of computers.
This file determines the
.Tn MPCC
board 
configurations. You can download either a synchronous , bisync or
an asynchronous protocol to an
.Tn MPCC
board.
(See
.Xr dlmpcc 8
for details.)
.Pp
A
.Nm mpcctab
file is supplied
with each
.Tn MPCC
release; however, 
you can modify this file or create your own file.
.Pp
The contents of the file 
consists of entries that describe supported communication 
protocols and their unique attributes. The protocols supported are
.Tn X Ns \&.25 ,
.Tn SNA ,
.Tn ASYNC ,
and
.Tn BISYNC .
For
.Tn ASYNC
two different entries are possible in the 
.Em procol
field - if 16 port
.Tn MPCC
async is configured, then
.Tn ASYNC
is 
entered; 32 port
.Tn MPCC
async is specified by entering
.Pf \&32 Tn PORT .
This file must reside in the directory
.Pa /usr/libdata .
.Sh Entry Line Format
An entry line consists of an
.Em item identifier
followed by 
variable width arguments separated by colons. There are three 
item identifiers:
.Tn MPCC , 
.Tn PROTOCOL ,
.Tn PORT .
The
.Tn MPCC
line in this file
identifies the board number. The
.Tn PROTOCOL
line identifies
the specific communication protocol.
The
.Tn PORT
line describes
the port for the immediately preceding protocol. The number
of arguments for the
.Tn PROTOCOL
and
.Tn PORT
lines,
and the arguments themselves, 
are protocol dependent. See the individual
argument descriptions for details.
.Pp
Notes: Use upper case letters for clarity when specifying the item 
identifier and the protocol name. Make sure that you enter
the argument values in the order specified below. Also, use comments 
liberally, and indicate comment lines by placing a 
pound sign
.Pq Sy #
in column one. 
.Pp
The item identifiers and their corresponding line
formats, with valid argument values, follow:

Argument Explanations: 
.Bl -tag -width indent -offset indent
.It Em bdno 
Specifies the board number.
.It Sy FCCS 
.Tn FCCS
is a fault-tolerant support system that allows backup ports
to assume the functions of failed ports.
For example,
if port 0 fails for any reason,
another port may be configured to assume the duties of the failed port.
The keyword
.Sy FCCS
identifies this feature and must be
followed by the list of fail-safe port numbers and a time increment,
described below.
This feature is optional.
.It Sy SOC 
An
.Tn FCCS
port can also be an
.Tn SOC
(Switch On Close) port,
meaning that the port will switch when it is closed.
And as with
.Tn FCCS ,
the port will switch if it fails.
This feature is optional.
.It Em portno 
.Em Portno
is a list of port numbers,
separated by commas,
specifying the primary ports you want protected by backup ports.
.Tn FCCS
boards have either 4 primary and 4 backup ports,
or 8 primary and 8 backup ports.
The valid port numbers are
.Sy 0
through
.Sy 3
for the 4-port version,
and
.Sy 0
through
.Sy 7
for the 8-port version.
.Pp
Each of the ports has a switched connector.
If the board fails for any reason,
the traffic on these ports is automatically routed
through the switched connector.
These connectors must be cabled to secondary ports on the other
.Tn FCCS
connector panels.
The secondary ports are numbered 8 through 11 on the 4-port version and
8 through 15 on the 8-port version.
Only the primary ports need be designated in the
.Tn FCCS
configuration line,
however all ports must be identified as described in the
.Tn PORT
Line section
below.
.It Em time 
Specifies the time period for the sentinel relay timer. 
Each board resets its sentinel timer after the specified
time period. If the
board fails, and therefore can't set the timer, then control
is passed automatically to another board, which continues 
the current processing. This feature ensures
.Dq PerpetualProcessing
and is transparent to the user. The valid range of values
in milliseconds is from
.Sy 50
to
.Sy 5950
in 
50 millisecond increments.
