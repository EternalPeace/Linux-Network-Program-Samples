The controller provides high-speed
synchronous communications for the
.Tn POWER

.Tn POWER
6 families of computers.
This utility allows you to 
download any or all of the
.Tn MPCC
boards.
The configuration file
.Pa mpcctab

the protocol attributes for each
.Tn MPCC
board. See
.Xr mpcctab 4
for details.

.Xr dlmpcc
scans the configuration file
.Pa mpcctab
and downloads all configured boards
with corresponding protocol software.

.Nm dlmpcc
to download only the protocol software identified with board 2:
.Pp
.Dl dlmpcc  2
.Pp
The next command line orders the download of the protocols identified with
boards 0 and 3: 
.Pp
.Dl dlmpcc  0  3
