-------- Remove this line and what's below it, for reference only. --------

To ensure that your bug report is handled correctly by bugfiler(8),
you must replace "folder" (on the line above starting with "Index:")
with one of the following values:

	folder  ::= bin | doc | etc | games | ideas | include | lib
			| local | man | misc | new | sys | ucb
			| usr.bin | usr.lib

If you're not running 4.3BSD, you should also replace "4.3BSD" on
the same line with one of the following values.

	version ::= 4.3BSD | 4.3BSD-tahoe | 4.3BSD-reno | net2
			   | 4.4BSD-alpha

For example, if your bug concerns the program "/usr/bin/file" and
you're currently running 4.3BSD-Reno, you should replace "folder"
with "usr.bin/file", and "4.4BSD-alpha" with "4.3BSD-Reno".  The folder
"ideas" is for suggestions.
