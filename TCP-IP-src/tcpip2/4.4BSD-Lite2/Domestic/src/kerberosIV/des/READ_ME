This directory contains the sources for the DES encryption library and
test programs.  

Two precautions-- 

1)  under US law, DES software and hardware may not be
	exported without license from the US Dept of Commerce.

2)	The only way to get a significant speedup of the algorithm is to
	use considerably more space, traded against time. Dont play
	with the code -- there is a high probability you will either
	make it slower, or wrong, or both.  This implementation was
	optimized for the UVAX 2.  Other architectures could benefit from
	some "asm" tweaking.

3)	If you do play with the code, make sure that the test program
	"verify" still yields the expected answers.  Otherwise, your
	ciphertext will not decrypt under a standard implementation, such
	as on the VLSI chips that have been certified.
