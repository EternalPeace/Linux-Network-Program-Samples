The files in this archive are the example programs from Chapter 1 of
"TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 3: TCP for Transactions, HTTP, NNTP, and
the UNIX Domain Protocols" by W. Richard Stevens (Addison-Wesley, 1996).

All the source code files assume tabs stop every 4 columns, not 8.  With
vi I use ":set tabstop=4".

The files with "time" in their name are versions that can be used to time
the client-server transactions (used for Figure 1.14 of the text).  The
three server programs with "time" in their name also allow a command-line
option specifying how long they should sleep, to simulate the server
processing time.  Also notice that these "time" clients have a doubly
nested loop: one for the request-reply size and another for the number
of iterations.

The two T/TCP files with "big" in their name define the request and reply
size to exceed one MSS (used for the example in Section 3.6 of the text).

*Before* trying to make these programs, do something like

	cc -c error.c sleepus.c
	ar -crv libmisc.a error.o sleepus.o
	ranlib libmisc.a	# needed for a BSD-derived system

Then change the definitions of CC, CFLAGS, and LIBS in the Makefile,
as appropriate for your system.  Then you can "make all".
