README.txt - Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible - edition 3 bash shell scripts.

  Thank you for purchasing the Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible (edition 3)!
We have provided the final bash shell scripts for each book's chapters that had shell scripts listed within them.

***** How to Unpack the Scripts *****

  Before unpacking and trying out the scripts, it would be best to read Chapters 1 - 9 in the book.
  
  The scripts have been packaged into a compressed archive.
(See Chapter 4's "Archiving Data" section for more information.)

To unpack the scripts on a Linux system: 

1) Move the Scripts.tgz archive file to your Linux system, if not there already.

2) Change your present working directory to the same directory where the Scripts.tgz file is located.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on commands to accomplish these tasks.)

3) Unpack the Scripts.tgz archive file by typing in the command:  tar -zxvf Scripts.tgz


***** How the Scripts are Organized *****

  In this package you will find a file folder for each chapter which had bash shell scripts.
If a chapter did NOT have shell scripts, there will be no chapter folder.


***** How to Run the Scripts *****

  If you want to try out the scripts BEFORE you start reading the book, (though not recommended) here is how.
After you have downloaded and unpacked the script package, go to the directory where the scripts are located.
At the command line, type in: bash scriptname.sh  Where "scriptname" is the name of the script file you wish to try out.

***** WARNING *****

  If you receive an error similar to "/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory" when you run a script,
then for some reason DOS line endings have been introduced into the script.

To convert these DOS line endings to Unix line endings, either install and use the dos2unix utility or:
  1) Use the vi editor on the script (See Chapter 9)
  2) Type :set ff=unix
     and then type :wq


***** Suggestions *****
  
These scripts were purposely written to be expanded by you!

You should find several items within the various scripts that can be improved upon.
Also, you will find some scripts that can be modified to include additional functionality.
Use the book as a guide along with the scripts provided here to learn how you can make modifications to them.

  A great way to learn is to read a script's code along with the text in the book, and then try out some modifications to the script.
It's okay to make mistakes as you make modifications! That is a great way to learn.
